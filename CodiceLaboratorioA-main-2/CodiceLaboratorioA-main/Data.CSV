Germs : Biological Weapons and America's Secret War;By Miller, Judith, Engelberg, Stephen, and Broad, William J.;Deadly germs sprayed in shopping malls, bomb-lets spewing anthrax spores over battlefields, tiny vials of plague scattered in Times Square -- these are the poor man's hydrogen bombs, hideous weapons of mass destruction that can be made in a simple laboratory. In this groundbreaking work of investigative journalism, Judith Miller, Stephen Engelberg, and William Broad of The New York Times uncover the truth about biological weapons and show why bio-warfare and bio-terrorism are fast becoming our worst national nightmare.  Among the startling revelations in Germs:   How the CIA secretly built and tested a model of a Soviet-designed germ bomb, alarming some officials who felt the work pushed to the limits of what is permitted by the global treaty banning germ arms. How the Pentagon embarked on a secret effort to make a superbug. Details about the Soviet Union's massive hidden program to produce biological weapons, including new charges that germs were tested on humans. How Moscow's scientists made an untraceable germ that instructs the body to destroy itself. The Pentagon's chaotic efforts to improvise defenses against Iraq's biological weapons during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. How a religious cult in Oregon in the 1980s sickened hundreds of Americans in a bio-terrorism attack that the government played down to avoid panic and copycat strikes. Plans by the U.S. military in the 1960s to attack Cuba with germ weapons.   Germs also shows how a small group of scientists and senior officials persuaded President Bill Clinton to launch a controversial multibillion-dollar program to detect a germ attack on U.S. soil and to aid its victims -- a program that, so far, is struggling to provide real protection.  Based on hundreds of interviews with scientists and senior officials, including President Clinton, as well as on recently declassified documents and on-site reporting from the former Soviet Union's sinister bio-weapons labs, Germs shows us bio-warriors past and present at work at their trade. There is the American scientist who devoted his professional life to perfecting biological weapons, and the Nobel laureate who helped pioneer the new biology of genetically modified germs and is now trying to stop its misuse. We meet former Soviet scientists who made enough plague, smallpox, and anthrax to kill everyone on Earth and whose expertise is now in great demand by terrorists, rogue states, and legitimate research labs alike.  A frightening and unforgettable narrative of cutting-edge science and spycraft, Germs shows us why advances in biology and the spread of germ weapons expertise to such countries as Iran, Iraq, and North Korea could make germs the weapon of the twenty-first century.; Technology & Engineering , Military Science;Simon & Schuster;4.99;October;2001

All over but the Shoutin';By Bragg, Rick;A New York Times Notable Book of the YearThis haunting, harrowing, gloriously moving recollection of a life on the American margin is the story of Rick Bragg, who grew up dirt-poor in northeastern Alabama, seemingly destined for either the cotton mills or the penitentiary, and instead became a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for The New York Times. It is the story of Bragg's father, a hard-drinking man with a murderous temper and the habit of running out on the people who needed him most.But at the center of this soaring memoir is Bragg's mother, who went eighteen years without a new dress so that her sons could have school clothes and picked other people's cotton so that her children wouldn't have to live on welfare alone. Evoking these lives--and the country that shaped and nourished them--with artistry, honesty, and compassion, Rick Bragg brings home the love and suffering that lie at the heart of every family. The result is unforgettable.; Biography & Autobiography , Personal Memoirs;Vintage;4.89;September;1998

Hill Rat: Blowing the Lid Off Congress;By Jackley, John L.;"As a top aide to powerful Texas Congressman Ronald Coleman, John Jackley watched the nation's highest elected officials lie, manipulate media images, and spend millions of taxpayer dollars to stay in power. The mind-boggling scope of the abuse of perks and privilege by both legislators and their staffers finally shocked him into reality.What began as a secret journal for his children to clear his conscience has become Hill Rat, a journey behind Congress' closed doors and into the corrupt back alleys of power. With both humor and outrage, Jackley reveals how the promise of Congress has been hijacked and corrupted by the current crop of careerist incumbents. ""Today,"" he writes, ""a successful congressman has the fundraising ability of a hooker trying to make cab fare home and the morals of a big-time football coach!""His account is laced with the names of Capitol Hill's most prominent legislators--Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, Speaker of the House Thomas Foley, Ron Dellums, Bill Alexander, Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, Thomas Luken, and scores of others. Jackley also reveals, with names, dates, and examples, the outrageous power of Congressional staffers--""Hill Rats""--who ""run the engines of democracy on a daily basis and pride themselves on their ability to do anything in the name of their cause.""To show the flagrant abuse of taxpayers' money for re-election purposes, Jackley points out that in just forty-eight hours in early 1992, the House mailed more than 58 million newsletters and postcards. In 1990, the first post-Jim Wright, post-congressional scandal election, 96% of the incumbents who ran were reelected. Even in 1988, only six Members running for re-election were defeated, a turnover rate less than that of the Soviet Politburo.From previously untold Congressional involvement in Oliver North's contra re-supply network to Democratic complicity in the S&L crisis to the taxpayer-funded incumbent protection plan, Hill Rat reveals secrets backed by hard evidence that will shake the House and shock the nation."; Political Science , General;Regnery Publishing, Inc.;4.99;April;1992

Shadow Song;By Kay, Terry;"It was a wonderful summer, a great memory, the kind of love everybody ought to have. It changed my life - or almost did - and I think about it more than I should, but that was a long time ago.Amid the breathtaking beauty of the Catskill Mountains, Avrum Feldman listened to the haunting voice of Amelita Galli-Curci ringing over the Shandaken Valley - a voice no one else could hear. When he died at age one hundred six, his obsession for the famous opera diva had lasted three-quarters of a century. Most people considered Avrum crazy, someone preoccupied with romantic nonsense. But Madison Lee ""Bobo"" Murphy was not among them, for he, too, had a love that changed his life, or almost did: Amy Lourie.In the summer of 1955, Bobo was a waiter at the Catskill's Pine Hill Inn; a rural Southerner who had never heard the word meshugge until Avrum - a retired furrier, teacher, and translator from New York City - became his unlikely friend. For Bobo nothing about that summer ever lost its glow: his first taste of kartoffel suppe; the exotic mingling of Yiddish and German in the dining room; the girl he met and loved....In everyone's life, Avrum had instructed, there is one grand, undeniable moment of change that never stops mattering. It came for Bobo in his first meeting with Amy, the most beautiful girl he had ever seen. He was too naive to comprehend the gulf between their worlds, and she was too smitten by him to care. But for a wealthy Jewish girl and a Georgia farm boy, the summer had to end, leaving Bobo to learn the painful lesson of loving someone and believing you cannot be with them.Now, thirty-eight years later, Avrum is gone, leaving a will that beckons Bobo north to the Catskills once more. In the places he'd walked so often on the paths of memory, he embraces the ghosts of old friendships and the haunting hints of Amy's presence, until she unexpectedly appears. Nothing has dimmed the passion of their youth, yet two lifetimes and a thousand Catskills sunsets stand between who they were and who they have become. The strikes against them are different now, but mysteriously, miraculously, as Bobo carries out Avrum's last wishes for a strange Kaddish, he hears the dreams of his youth, of the young man who went forth and became part of a love larger than himself...."; Fiction , General;Atria Books;4.99;October;1994

Codebreakers' Victory: How the Allied Cryptogaphers Won World War II;By Haufler, Hervie;"For the first time ever, veteran World War II cryptographer Hervie Haufler details how American and British codebreakers were the decisive factor in the Allied victory. From the Purple Machine to the Navajo Talkers to the breaking of Japan's JN-25 Naval Code to the shadowy world of decoding units like Hut-8 in Bletchley Park, he shows how crucial information-often obtained by surreptitious and violent means-was the decisive edge in the Battle of Britain, at Midway and against the U-Boats in the North Atlantic, and how Allied intelligence saved the Soviet Union from almost certain defeat.  In an accessible account based on years of research, interviews and exclusive access to previously top-secret archives, Haufler demonstrates how cryptography enabled Nimitz and MacArthur to persevere in the Pacific and helped Eisenhower and Patton mount the assaults on Normandy. In compelling detail, Haufler shows us how it was done-as only one who was on the frontlines of the ""secret war"" could tell it."; History , Military , World War II;NAL Trade;5.29;November;2003

Meditations: On the Monk Who Dwells in Daily Life;By Moore, Thomas;Sometimes in their chanting monks will land upon a note and sing it in florid fashion, one syllable of text for fifty notes of chant. Melisma, they call it.Living a melismatic life in imitation of plainchant, we may stop on an experience, a place, a person, or a memory and rhapsodize in imagination. Some like to meditate or contemplate melismatically, while others prefer to draw, build, paint, or dance whatever their eye has fallen upon.Living one point after another, is one form of experience, and it can be emphatically productive. But stopping for melisma gives the soul its reason for being.; Religion , General;HarperCollins;4.99;November;1994

How Good Do We Have to Be? A New Understanding of Guilt and Forgiveness;By Kushner, Harold S.;From the author of When Bad Things Happen to Good People comes an inspiring new bestseller that puts human feelings of guilt and inadequacy in perspective - and teaches us how we can learn to accept ourselves and others even when we and they are less than perfect. How Good Do We Have to Be? is for everyone who experiences that sense of guilt and disappointment. Harold Kushner, writing with his customary generosity and wisdom, shows us how human life is too complex for anyone to live it without making mistakes, and why we need not fear the loss of God's love when we are less than perfect. Harold Kushner begins by offering a radically new interpretation of the story of Adam and Eve, which he sees as a tale of Paradise Outgrown rather than Paradise Lost: eating from the Tree of Knowledge was not an act of disobedience, but a brave step forward toward becoming human, complete with the richness of work, sexuality and child-rearing, and a sense of our mortality. Drawing on modern literature, psychology, theology,,and his own thirty years of experience as a congregational rabbi, Harold Kushner reveals how acceptance and forgiveness can change our relationships with the most important people in our lives and help us meet the bold and rewarding challenge of being human.; Religion , Psychology of Religion;Back Bay Books;4.99;September;1997

Love, Love, and Love;By Bernhard, Sandra;"Even if you know Sandra Bernhard as an actress, singer, comedian, and performer, you're in for quite a shock with this, her second book. A mix of memoir, fiction, invented memoir, and fiction that rings with the truth, Love Love and Love charts the state of romance, sex, and relationships - the need to love and be loved - in several cities, and several sexes, around the world. The same biting wit, fragile irony, and arresting candor of Sandra's performances are all here, but Love Love and Love is also filled with an intimacy and an insight that are all new... and all Bernhard.Here are the stories of a relationship built on the weapon of romance; of an elusive girl, and the various drugs she gives and takes; of dreams and daydreams that melt into truth; of the touch of a lover's skin at the break of dawn; and of all the pain and cruelty that go along so well with the ecstasy we all want to possess. This is a book about relationships born of chance meetings on the street at night; about sexual obsessions, frayed emotions, and haunting memories of both the quick and the dead. Love Love and Love is by turns shocking and exhilarating, angry and passionate, analytical and sexy; it's all about that strange state of being that merges sensations only of the moment with an emotion that has existed since the birth of humankind.As Sandra herself notes: ""Love is the only shocking act left on the face of the earth.""";;HarperCollins;5.29;August;1993
Conflicting Accounts: The Creation and Crash of the Saatchi and Saatchi Advertising Empire;By Goldman, Kevin;On December 16, 1994, a bloodletting took place in the stylish sixth-floor boardroom at Saatchi & Saatchi Company PLC, once the world's largest advertising agency holding company. Maurice Saatchi, the 48 year-old chairman who co-founded the company in 1970 with his older brother Charles, was fired by the board of directors under threat by the firm's largest shareholders. Less than a month later, Maurice started a rival ad agency and quickly snapped up former Saatchi & Saatchi clients, most importantly British Airways. Kevin Goldman, the former daily advertising columnist for the Wall Street Journal, spoke to everyone connected with this headline-making saga -- including Maurice Saatchi and his reclusive brother Charles -- and witnessed important business meetings, including Maurice Saatchi's winning pitch to British Airways. Goldman traces every step the Saatchi brothers took, from their youth as Iraqi Jewish immigrants in North London to their business merger in 1970, when, with little more than sheer audacity, the opened an ad agency with a full-page announcement ad in the London Sunday Times. Through bold and brash actions, the agency began an acquisitions binge, taking over many of the ad industry's giants -- including Ted Bates, Backer & Spielvogel, Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, and Garland-Compton -- to become the number one ad company in the world. But, once they acquired a company, the brothers lost interest, often refusing to meet with its executives again. This disdain would come back to haunt them. Also chronicled is the brothers' rich lifestyle, which critics claim was funded by the company. This tale features a rich cast of supporting players: Jeremy Sinclair, a creative advertising genius who was fiercely loyal to the brothers, was one of the executives who resigned after Maurice was fired. Bill Muirhead, another loyalist, was responsible for keeping clients happy. Robert Louis-Dreyfus, a globe-trotting native of France, was brought in by the Saatchis in 1989 when the company was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. Louis-Dreyfus brought in Charles Scott, a self-described numbers cruncher uncomfortable with the glitzy world of advertising, to help sort out the company's complex finances. And leading the anti-Maurice movement was David Herro, a thirty-three-year-old American money manager whose group owned approximately 10 percent of Saatchi stock. Built into the Saatchi story is the bigger picture of the dramatic changes in advertising in the 1980s, such as the merger mania and ad agency consolidations that swept Madison Avenue, including the British takeover of major agencies. The story of the decline and crash of Saatchi & Saatchi is a universal tale of corporate greed and ineffective management. It is the story of an ugly, publicly fought civil war in an industry that is supposed to know the steep price paid for an image run amok.; Business & Economics , Advertising & Promotion;Touchstone;5.29;January;1998

Inside the Tornado: Marketing Strategies from Silicon Valley's Cutting Edge;By Moore, Geoffrey A.;"""The chasm is where high-tech fortunes are lost... the tornado is where they are made.""-- Steve Jobs, Founder & CEO, Next Computer, Inc.    Now, in this fascinating sequel, Moore shows how to capitalize on the profit-rich niches and hyper-growth markets beyond the chasm. Continuing to chart the impact of the Technology Adoption Life Cycle, he explores its effects not just on marketing but on overall business planning, especially strategic partnerships, competitive advantage, positioning and organizational leadership. Moore's most startling lesson is: ""As markets move from stage to stage in the Life Cycle, the winning strategy does not just change -- it actually reverses the prior strategy. The very skills that you've just perfected become your biggest liabilities; and if you can't put them aside to acquire new ones, then you're in for tough times."" As challenging as this lesson is to apply, Moore leads the way. Using actual examples of cutting-edge firms, he applies the Life Cycle model to all aspects of managing a market-focused business strategy, including how to manage people effectively through each phase of the cycle. There are significant management implications: Chasm-crossers who love the customer intimacy of niches may rebel against the depersonalizing power of the tornado; tornado managers who relish the gales of hyper-growth may resist the inevitable return to the niche, in the guise of mass customization, once the rush to the new paradigm subsides. All industries relying on technology -- not just computer hardware, software and telecommunications, but entertainment, publishing, broadcasting, banking, insurance, health care, aerospace, defense, utilities, pharmaceuticals and retail -- must master Moore's lessons to see the year 2000. If you are marketing technology-based products or managing the people who do, then you will find yourself Inside the Tornado."; Business & Economics , Marketing , General;Harper Business;5.29;October;1995

Sherlock Holmes and the Red Demon by John H. Watson, M.D.;By Watson, John H. and Millett, Larry (EDT);"It is the story of how the world's most beloved private detective, Sherlock Holmes, and Watson traveled to Minnesota in 1894 to find and stop a murderous arsonist, known only as the Red Demon, who is threatening both Hill and his Great Northern Railway. Homes's pursuit of this malignant and cunning villain presents the great man ""with the most remarkable case of his celebrated career.""In Minnesota, Holmes comes face-to-face with all manner of frontier characters, including two-fisted railroad men, rough-and-tumble lumberjacks, a one-eyed teamster, and an unsavory town marshal. But he also encounters the proprietress of the North Woods' most opulent sporting house, Mary Robinson, a woman as clever as she is beautiful. In response to a churlish remark from Dr. Watson about the morality of her establishment, she replies: ""Morality is a matter of power, nothing more and nothing less. The rich impose it on the poor, men impose it on women, and the forces of reaction impose it upon those who seek a better world.""Needless to say, Holmes becomes especially attentive to this suspect's articulate charm. But charm gives way to terror in the exciting climax of the tale, a chase on the rails that ends with Holmes and the Red Demon squared off on a lonely bridge in a fiery circle of death. ""Never,"" says Watson, ""was Holmes more magnificent than at that moment."""; Fiction , Mystery & Detective , General;Viking;4.99;September;1996

Elvis in the Morning;By Buckley, William F.;This is a novel about friendship, a novel that spans the decades that changed America forever. Orson is a young boy whose mother works at a U.S. Army base in Germany in the 1950s. There, he becomes a fan of a G.I. stationed at the base, one Elvis Presley, whose music is played over and over on the radio. When Orson is caught stealing recordings of Elvis's tunes from the PX, the attendant publicity catches the star's attention, and he comes to visit his young fan. Thus begins a lifelong friendship. As Elvis's career rockets ever higher and his behavior becomes ever more erratic, the two share many adventures. The sixties explode, and Elvis becomes the icon of the nation, while Orson, a college demonstrator, drifts away from regular life while looking for something of substance to believe in. Each man is an emblem of his time, as social conventions crumble, barriers fall, and the cultural landscape changes forever.A panorama of change and dissent, of the ability of friends to stay true despite distance and time, Elvis in the Morning portrays a nation in change and the effects of celebrity on innocence.; Fiction , Fantasy , Historical;Harvest Books;5.29;June;2002

Balkan Odyssey a personal account of the international peace efforts following the breakup of the former Yugoslavia;By Owen, David;Balkan Odyssey is David Owen's personal chronicle of the struggle to bring an end to the wars in the former Yugoslavia, wars marked by brutal campaigns of ethnic cleansing, war crimes, ultranationalism, religious bigotry, and racism. It offers a rare, unvarnished look inside the realm of international diplomacy. Owen describes the consequences of the Clinton Administration's opposition to the Vance-Owen peace plan. He recounts how other peace settlements were hindered by divisions between the United States, Europe, and Russia as well as the United Nations and NATO, and by the bad faith of warring leaders who believed they had more to gain through war than peace. Owen also gives an account of the NATO assault on Bosnian Serb positions and the latest attempts at reaching a settlement.Written with candor and reason, Balkan Odyssey is a day-to-day account of the traps and tangles of diplomacy and the enduring dangers of policy that is dictated by rhetoric instead of reality. It is an essential work for understanding the gravest threat to world peace since the height of the Cold War.;;Harcourt;5.12;March;1996

Understanding Thomas Jefferson;By Halliday, E. M.;Recent biographies of Thomas Jefferson have stressed the sphinxlike puzzles of his character—famous champion of freedom yet lifelong slaveholder, foe of miscegenation yet secret lover of a beautiful slave for 30 years, aristocrat yet fervent advocate of government by the people. E. M. Halliday's absorbing and lucid portrait recognizes these and other puzzles about this great founder, but shows us how understandable they can be in light of his personal and social circumstances. Halliday takes readers deep into Jefferson's private life—exploring his childhood, his literary taste, and his unconventional religious thinking and moral philosophy. Here, too, are his adamant opinions on women, the evolution of his ideas on democracy and freedom of expression, and fresh insights into his relationship with Sally Hemings.; Biography & Autobiography , Presidents & Heads of State;Harper Perennial;4.99;February;2002

Going the Other Way: Lessons from a Life In and Out of Major League Baseball;By Bean, Billy and Bull, Chris;Last spring Billy Bean, the only living openly gay former major leaguer, gained national attention with his breakthrough memoir, Going the Other Way?an unprecedented chronicle of America’s national pastime that went on to sell more than 25,000 copies. Bean brings us inside the clubhouse and onto the playing field, offering dead-on insight into the game and the physical and emotional demands it makes on players. Bean faced an agonizing choice, in secrecy and solitude, between continuing to play the game he loved and the honesty of a loving relationship. By turns heartbreaking and farcical, ruminative and uncensored, the book culminates in a respectful, deeply felt appeal to Major League Baseball and other professional team sports to live up to their promise of equality and opportunity. A testament to the power of the single voice, Going the Other Way is an exemplary American tale that points the way toward a more perfect game, one in which all men and women can pursue their athletic dreams free of prejudice and discrimination.

Constancia and Other Stories for Virgins;By Fuentes, Carlos and Christensen, Thomas (TRN);"Renowned as a novelist of unsurpassed invention, Carlos Fuentes here presents his second collection of stories to appear in English. Where his first,Burnt Water, published in 1980, had as its underlying theme Mexico City itself,Constancia and Other Stories for Virgins extends its imaginative boundaries out to Savannah, to Cadiz, to Glasgow, to Seville and Madrid, both past and present. This new collection is more mysterious, more magical, too, than its predecessor, and in its five related stories Fuentes comes closer to the registers of language and feeling that he explored so memorably inAura. It reveals Fuentes at the height of his powers--bold, erudite, enthralling.In the title story, a man discovers his wife's secret complicity with the Russian actor who is their neighbor--a complicity that includes not just a previous life but possibly a previous death as well. He finds himself ""a mediator . . . a point between one sorrow and the next, between one hope and the next, between two languages, two memories, two ages, and two deaths."" In ""La Desdichada,"" two students steal--and fall in love with--a store-window mannequin. In ""The Prisoner of Las Lomas,"" a wealthy lawyer in possession of a powerful secret is held hostage by the past he has attempted to subvert and keep at bay. The celebrated bullfighter whose fame is the theme of ""Viva Mi Fama"" steps from the present into a past immortalized by Goya's portrait of the matador Pedro Romero; and the architects who are the ""Reasonable People"" of that story find themselves drawn into the irrational mysteries not only of religious fervor but of their famous mentor's identity--they discover ""there are no empty houses,"" only a present fraught with the past.Though each of these novella-length stories offers compelling evidence of Fuentes's talent for narrative free rein as well as for containment and closure, they are also brilliantly interwoven. Readers of his earlier work, especially of his acclaimed ribald epic, Christopher Unborn, will recognize with pleasure Fuentes's undiminished mastery of recurrent images and themes, and all readers will delight in the witty and evocative changes he rings on them. For those few readers who do not yet know the work of Mexico's foremost man of letters, these stories offer them the full gift of his imaginative resourcefulness."; Fiction , Short Stories (single author);Farrar, Straus and Giroux;5.29;April;1990

For answers, the authors of Global Literacies went straight to the leaders themselves -- the CEOs of thousands of corporations around the globe.  Two lessons emerged. First, there are leadership universals that every executive and manager needs to practice in order to be world-class at home and abroad. The second defied conventional wisdom: in the borderless economy, culture doesn't matter less, it matters more.  Around the world, business leaders apply their own experiences -- personal, professional, and cultural -- to an ever-expanding world of Dutch colleagues, Brazilian suppliers, Taiwanese manufacturers, and Chinese competitors. These leaders are trying to become globally literate...and Global Literacies is for, and about, them.  No one knows this better than CEOs of successful global companies such as Japan's Canon, Sweden's Ericsson, Taiwan's Acer Computers, the U.K.'s British Telecommunications, and U.S.-based Coca-Cola.  In Global Literacies, a team of researchers led by Robert Rosen, Ph.D., of Healthy Companies International, and Watson Wyatt Worldwide have produced the first model of international business success based on a wide-ranging landmark study of global leaders and their world-class companies. Global Literacies documents the exclusive results of a worldwide survey of over one thousand senior executives and in-depth interviews with CEOs of seventy-eight companies -- companies representing 3.5 million employees in more than 200 countries, and with more than $725 billion in annual sales.  Global Literacies offers compelling new insights and business tools:  The Global Leadership Universals  Learn the new literacies of business:  * Personal Literacy -- understanding and valuing yourself * Social Literacy -- engaging and challenging people * Business Literacy -- focusing and mobilizing your business * Cultural Literacy -- valuing and leveraging cultural difference  The Global Success Quotient  Learn which are the most globally active, financially successful companies -- and countries -- in the world, understand how they got there, and apply those learnings to your own organization.  The Cultures of Twenty-first-Century Business  Develop ways to see global challenges and opportunities, think with an international mindset, act with fresh global-centric leadership behaviors, and mobilize world-class companies -- whether you're a multinational giant, a domestic manufacturer, or a local community organization.  National Profiles  With sophisticated profiles of thirty countries, and survey data from eighteen national cultures -- from the Tolerant Traders of the Netherlands to China's Ancient Modernizers and the Optimistic Entrepreneurs of the United States, Global Literacies is a groundbreaking and fascinating work on the most important issues in the world of business today."; Business & Economics , Management;Simon & Schuster;4.99;November;2000

I Wish I Had a Red Dress;By Cleage, Pearl;"Joyce Mitchell was widowed far too young when her beloved husband, Mitch, died in a tragic accident five years ago. Since then she's kept her hands full and her mind and heart occupied by running The Sewing Circus, an all-girl group she founded to provide badly needed services like day care and job counseling to young women, many of whom are single mothers. More important, The Circus is a place for lively, wide-ranging, heart-to-heart discussions that will help members grow into what Joyce likes to call ""twenty-first-century free women.""All in all, Joyce has a full and rich life. She has her work, her family, her friends, and her town. But there are some nights when she crawls into bed alone and has to admit that something is missing. What she doesn't have is that red dress she keeps dreaming about or a social life that would accommodate it even if she braved the mail and bought one. To further complicate matters, she may not have The Sewing Circus much longer, as the state legislature has decided not to fund the group's vital but hard-todefine work with young women who are too often regarded as problems rather than possibilities.Feeling defeated and pessimistic, Joyce reluctantly agrees to keep a date for dinner at the home of her best friend, Sister -- a reverend like no other-and finds not only a perfect meal but a tall, dark stranger named Nate Anderson. Nate has just joined the administration at the high school and his unexpected presence in Idlewild touches a chord in Joyce that she thought her heart had forgotten how to play. Nate feels the same immediate connection, but both have enough experience with broken hearts to take it real slow. Besides, they've got too much work to do to concentrate on falling in love....But life moves at its own pace, and as Sister says, ""if you want to make God laugh, make plans."" Particularly when it comes to matters of the heart. Joyce decides the trick is to stay focused and to remember that nothing is as sexy as the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, especially if you tell it while you're wearing a perfect red dress...."; Fiction , Literary;William Morrow;5.29;July;2001

The Visitation;By Reidy, Sue;The Flynn girls, just two of a seemingly endless number of Flynn children, are naturally curious about where their little siblings come from. Well versed in the bizarre lives and gruesome deaths of their favorite saints, they have yet to crack the mysteries of the more earthly concerns of procreation and human relations. Blessed enlightenment comes, however, when the Virgin Mary appears and asks them to buy her suitable clothes for her earthly mission -- a campaign for birth control. Set against the backdrop of the impending Vatican II decisions that wreaked havoc on many Catholic lives and the sprawl of the more permissive 1960s, this crackling, smart, and thoughtful novel is sure to delight.; Fiction , General;Scribner;5.29;December;1997

Chinese Roundabout: Essays in History and Culture;By Spence, Jonathan D.;"The spirit of adventure is at the heart of Jonathan Spence's widely acclaimed scholarship on the modern history of China. This vitality, fleshed out with deep research and attired in elegant style, has drawn countless readers to subjects otherwise approachable only by experts. Through eight books, from the story of the early eighteenth century Manchu bondservant Ts'ao Yin to his magisterial history, The Search for Modern China, Spence has made the excitement of intellectual discovery palpable for us all. In the course of his fruitful career Spence has written many shorter pieces as well, and the best of these are collected for the first time in Chinese Roundabout. Here the reader will meet Arcadio Huang, the Chinese linguist and Christian convert who moves from south China to Enlightenment Paris, marries a French woman, and in conversations with Montesquieu becomes the likely source for the Persian Letters. The poignant story of Huang's hard-won success and final defeat by poverty and disease illustrates the perils of crossing cultures. Spence's delight in intellectual risk animates his Shakespearean approach to the life of the great Qing emperor in ""The Seven Ages of K'ang-hsi."" Spence's great learning informs an authoritative essay on China's tragic experience with opium. Following the social process of addiction from the cultivation of poppies and the processing of the drug through its introduction by the British into China, its widespread distribution and consumption by Chinese, and the public struggle to suppress opium use, Spence explores issues of historical and contemporary interest. In an equally substantial piece he focuses on the cultural dimensions of food in Qing China, illuminating the marginal diet of a peasantry constantly threatened by famine as well as the grand banquets of the literati and the imperial household. In the work of 25 years, Spence has established himself as a brilliant interpreter of modern Chinese history. His books—among them the recent national bestseller The Search for Modern China—exhibit uncommon imagination, unobtrusive learning, verve, and elegance. These same qualities animate the essays gathered here."; Social Science , Customs & Traditions;W. W. Norton & Company, Inc.;5.35;April;1993

From Queen Maeve of Connaught to President Mary Robinson, this book presents Irish women as their compatriots—men and women both—have described and interpreted them.Modern Irish women are outspoken about the issues that rouse their passion—love and sex, marriage and divorce, abortion and adoption. As Katie Donovan says in her introduction: ""Our selection is intended to give the reader a taste of the varied spectrum, from the courtly praise of men to swinish male chauvinism; from women's declarations of outrage against church and state to their celebrations of childbirth and motherhood."" This book celebrates the vast range of women's thought and activity, their spirituality, and their passions.The women who appear in this collection are both well known and unknown, real and invented. The editors have drawn freely upon translations of the mythological tales and later Irish poems, upon letters, biographies, and newspapers as well as prose and poetry, plays, recordings and songs, in order to present a complex multilayered and richly rewarding view of Ireland's women."; Fiction , Short Stories (single author);W.

There he falls physically ill and is nursed back to health by Bronwen Vaughn, the wife of a neighboring farmer.

Deployment: Hiding Behind Power Struggles as a Character Defense (Psychoanalytic Therapy Series);By Moses-Hrushovski, Rena;Embattled, feeling victimized and entitled, many patients once again seek out help despite previous years of unsuccessful psychotherapy or analysis. Feeling frozen and unable to change and putting up a seemingly impenetrable wall of resistance, such patients are among the most difficult to reach. In this original work, Israeli psychologist Rena Moses-Hrushovski describes her therapeutic endeavors with such patients. She discovered in many such people a specific form of narcissistic character resistance which she terms deployment. Deployment is a vigilant use of the balances of interpersonal power designed to ward off intolerable feelings, predominantly of envy, shame, and guilt. Patients who use deployment put themselves in the role of the victim and then battle against perceived injustice, abuse, and oppression for the right to be understood and accepted. Such patients often expect the therapist to take responsibility for their suffering.In addition to exploring deployment as a kind of self organization, Dr. Moses-Hrushovski details her formulation of treatment approaches that enable her to build bridges to these patients and help them uncover and live with the feeling states that they are desperately trying to ward off.; Medical , General;Jason Aronson, Inc.;4.99;January;1994

The Abuse Excuse: And Other Cop-Outs, Sob Stories, and Evasions of Responsibility;By Dershowitz, Alan M.;"According to renowned defense attorney and Harvard law professor Alan M. Dershowitz, ""abuse excuses"" are enabling people to get away with murder - literally. From the Menendez brothers to Lorena Bobbitt, more and more Americans accused of violent crimes are admitting to the charges, but arguing that they shouldn't be held legally responsible. The reason: they're victims - of an abusive parent, a violent spouse, a traumatic experience, ethnic hatred, society at large, or anything else - who struck back at a real or perceived oppressor. And they couldn't help themselves, they say.In this provocative and important collection of essays, Dershowitz reviews a wide range of recent cases - including those of O. J. Simpson, Tonya Harding, and Woody Allen - and argues that the current vogue in victim defenses is antithetical to the ideals of our constitutional democracy. For Dershowitz, the foundations of American society are individual responsibility and the rule of law. And people who claim to be above the law - whatever the excuse - are no more than vigilantes."; Social Science , General;Little Brown & Co;5.47;October;1994

Horsewatching: Why does a horse whinny and everything else you ever wanted to know;By Morris, Desmond;How intelligent are horses? Why do they toss their heads and what makes them paw the ground?After spending more than twenty years studying the body language of the human species, Desmond Morris has turned his attention to the behavior of some of our closest animal companions. First he looked at dogs, then cats, and now horses. As Curator of Mammals at the London Zoo he was able to study closely the zebras and wild horse in his charge. More recently, as a racehorse owner, he has scrutinized the glamorous world of thoroughbred racing.Throughout his long involvement with horses, Desmond Morris has never stopped asking questions. InHorsewatching he sets out to answer them. As a zoologist and a lifelong student of animal behavior, he approaches the horse world in an unusual way, dealing with topics often ignored in equine literature. In addition to examining details of behavior, Dr Morris considers such questions as why horseshoes bring good luck, why we don’t eat horses, why jockeys are allowed to whip their mounts and why we call a bad dream a nightmare.And for punters everywhere, he applies his zoological mind to the all-important question of why some horses run faster than others…; Technology & Engineering , General;Crown;4.99;April;1989

Ghost Light: A Memoir;By Rich, Frank;"There is a superstition that if an emptied theater is ever left completely dark, a ghost will take up residence. To prevent this, a single ""ghost light"" is left burning at center stage after the audience and all of the actors and musicians have gone home. Frank Rich's eloquent and moving boyhood memoir reveals how theater itself became a ghost light and a beacon of security for a child finding his way in a tumultuous world.Rich grew up in the small-townish Washington, D.C., of the 1950s and early '60s, a place where conformity seemed the key to happiness for a young boy who always felt different. When Rich was seven years old, his parents separated--at a time when divorce was still tantamount to scandal--and thereafter he and his younger sister were labeled ""children from a broken home."" Bouncing from school to school and increasingly lonely, Rich became terrified of the dark and the uncertainty of his future. But there was one thing in his life that made him sublimely happy: the Broadway theater.Rich's parents were avid theatergoers, and in happier times they would listen to the brand-new recordings of South Pacific, Damn Yankees, and The Pajama Game over and over in their living room. When his mother's remarriage brought about turbulent changes, Rich took refuge in these same records, re-creating the shows in his imagination, scene by scene. He started collecting Playbills, studied fanatically the theater listings in The New York Times and Variety, and cut out ads to create his own miniature marquees. He never imagined that one day he would be the Times's chief theater critic.Eventually Rich found a second home at Wash-ington's National Theatre, where as a teenager he was a ticket-taker and was introduced not only to the backstage magic he had dreamed of for so long but to a real-life cast of charismatic and eccentric players who would become his mentors and friends. With humor and eloquence, Rich tells the triumphant story of how the aspirations of a stagestruck young boy became a lifeline, propelling him toward the itinerant family of theater, whose romantic denizens welcomed him into the colorful fringes of Broadway during its last glamorous era.Every once in a while, a grand spectacle comes along that introduces its audiences to characters and scenes that will resound in their memories long after the curtain has gone down.Ghost Light, Frank Rich's beautifully crafted childhood memoir, is just such an event."; Biography & Autobiography , Entertainment & Performing Arts;Random House Trade Paperbacks;5.29;October;2001

How To Live Through A Bad Day: 7 Powerful Insights From Christ's Words on the Cross;By Hayford, Jack W.;"Each of us has experienced bad days, and these bad days are often compounded by our focus on the ""badness"" of the situation. But Dr. Jack Hayford contends that,"" in such times the Lord calls us to hear His voice."" And so, beginning with seven phrases uttered by Jesus on the cross, he constructs the model for godly behavior while enduring hardship. Insights include:Father, forgive them for they know not what they do. To forgive those seeking to injure you is to remove yourself from their control.My God, my God, why have you forsaken Me? We can ask God the hard questions.Into Your hands I commit My spirit. Surrender your suffering to God and let go.How to Live Through a Bad Day is ideal for anyone who has experienced stress, pain, weariness, or an assault of character.

Much-loved chef and amateur sleuth Eugenia Potter finds herself mixed up in murder in The 27-Ingredient Chili con Carne Murders, a book that marks the exciting collaboration of two mistresses of mystery, Nancy Pickard and Virginia Rich.When Eugenia Potter receives an urgent phone call from the manager of her ranch, Las Palomas, in Tucson, she's only too happy to drop everything and fly home. After all, something inside her is telling her to get back to the desert ranch - why else would she be cooking spicy Mexican meatball soup at her cottage in Maine, when clam chowder should be on the menu?But along with the excitement she feels at going home is an inexplicable sense of foreboding, which is tragically realized once she arrives in Tucson. The ranch manager and his granddaughter are missing from Las Palomas and feared dead. A cryptic note written by one of them containing initials and a meeting time is the only clue that leads Mrs. Potter to suspect foul play. But why would anyone want to harm her old friends? And where could they have disappeared to?When a guest at a dinner gathering thrown by Mrs. Potter winds up dead - apparently from eating her own famous 27-ingredient chili - Mrs. Potter knows she must get involved in solving the crimes before the murderer strikes again.In the midst of these disturbing goings-on, an old love from Eugenia's past arrives on the scene to spice up the danger with a bit of romance.

Looking for Alaska;By Jenkins, Peter;"More than twenty years ago, a disillusioned college graduate named Peter Jenkins set out with his dog Cooper to look for himself and his nation.  His memoir of what he found, A Walk Across America, captured the hearts of millions of Americans.Now, Peter is a bit older, married with a family, and his journeys are different than they were. Perhaps he is looking for adventure, perhaps inspiration, perhaps new communities, perhaps unspoiled land.  Certainly, he found all of this and more in Alaska, America's last wilderness.Looking for Alaska is Peter's account of eighteen months spent traveling over twenty thousand miles in tiny bush planes, on snow machines and snowshoes, in fishing boats and kayaks, on the Alaska Marine Highway and the Haul Road, searching for what defines Alaska. Hearing the amazing stories of many real Alaskans--from Barrow to Craig, Seward to Deering, and everywhere in between--Peter gets to know this place in the way that only he can. His resulting portrait is a rare and unforgettable depiction of a dangerous and beautiful land and all the people that call it home.  He also took his wife and eight-year-old daughter with him, settling into a ""home base"" in Seward on the Kenai Peninsula, coming and going from there, and hosting the rest of their family for extended visits. The way his family lived, how they made Alaska their home and even participated in Peter's explorations, is as much a part of this story as Peter's own travels.All in all, Jenkins delivers a warm, funny, awe-inspiring, and memorable diary of discovery-both of this place that captures all of our imaginations, and of himself, all over again."; Travel , United States , West , Pacific (AK, CA, HI, OR, WA);St. Martin's Press;5.94;November;2001

Crossing Over Jordan;By Brown, Linda Beatrice;"Georgia McCloud lives to see emancipation. Her daughter Sadie discovers that, though she might be free, she is powerless to break with a man who abuses her. At the center of their communal pain is Sadie's intelligent, beautiful, ambitious daughter Story, who wants more from life than she's been led to expect. Her uncompromising desire for ""safety"" corrupts Story to her very soul, dooming her to wander an emotional desert, repressed, rigid, enslaved to propriety. Her daughter Hermine must then challenge the lie that life is hardship. But can Hermine finally break the cycle of oppression that has chained the women of her family? Can she alone cross over Jordan?Reminiscent of the early work of Alice Walker and Gloria Naylor, Crossing Over Jordan deftly explores the themes of the mother-daughter relationship, the emotional scars left by history, the struggle to be authentic in the throes of great personal pain, and the transforming power of love.

Personal History;By Graham, Katharine;An extraordinarily frank, honest, and generous book by one of America's most famous and admired women -- a book that is, as its title suggests, composed of both personal memoir and history.It is the story of Graham's parents: the multimillionaire father who left private business and government service to buy and restore the down-and-out Washington Post, and the formidable, self-absorbed mother who was more interested in her political and charity work, and her passionate friendships with men like Thomas Mann and Adlai Stevenson, than in her children.It is the story of how The Washington Post struggled to succeed -- a fascinating and instructive business history as told from the inside (the paper has been run by Graham herself, her father, her husband, and now her son).It is the story of Phil Graham -- Kay's brilliant, charismatic husband (he clerked for two Supreme Court justices) -- whose plunge into manic-depression, betrayal, and eventual suicide is movingly and charitably recounted. Best of all, it is the story of Kay Graham herself. She was brought up in a family of great wealth, yet she learned and understood nothing about money. She is half-Jewish, yet -- incredibly -- remained unaware of it for many years.She describes herself as having been naive and awkward, yet intelligent and energetic. She married a man she worshipped, and he fascinated and educated her, and then, in his illness, turned from her and abused her. This destruction of her confidence and happiness is a drama in itself, followed by the even more intense drama of her new life as the head of a great newspaper and a great company, a famous (and even feared) woman in her own right. Hers is a life that came into its own with a vengeance -- a success story on every level.Graham's book is populated with a cast of fascinating characters, from fifty years of presidents (and their wives), to Steichen, Brancusi, Felix Frankfurter, Warren Buffett (her great advisor and protector), Robert McNamara, George Schultz (her regular tennis partner), and, of course, the great names from the Post: Woodward, Bernstein, and Graham's editor/partner, Ben Bradlee. She writes of them, and of the most dramatic moments of her stewardship of the Post (including the Pentagon Papers, Watergate, and the pressmen's strike), with acuity, humor, and good judgment. Her book is about learning by doing, about growing and growing up, about Washington, and about a woman liberated by both circumstance and her own great strengths.; Biography & Autobiography , Editors, Journalists, Publishers;Alfred A.

It is up to us to respond . . . to begin the conversation. And a conversation is the first step, just as in any relationship, in establishing trust, in building friendship, in creating communion.   In Friendship with God, Neale Donald Walsch shares the next part of his journey, and leads us to deepen and strengthen our own bonds with God.

Shella;By Vachss, Andrew H.;In his new novel Andrew Vachss moves beyond his powerful evocations of the private eye as pursuer and scourge of the evildoer. Now, in Sheila, he explores the making of evil - the depths beneath the lower depths of American society and the terrifying products of that netherworld where children are born into ultimate abandonment and abuse, where only a few survive and some emerge not fully human.One such survivor is the man known as Ghost.His personality has been formed, diamond-hard, in the crucible of chilly orphanages and hellish juvenile prisons. He has grown the way a baby alligator grows - in size alone, not in essence. He has no experience of nurture or education.He has become an instrument. A weapon to be used by predators.

Collected Stories of Reynolds Price;By Price, Reynolds;"For over three decades, Reynolds Price has been one of America's most distinguished writers, in a career that has been remarkable both for its virtuosity and for the variety of literary forms he has embraced. Now he shows himself as much a master of the story as he is of the novel, in a volume that presents fifty stories, including two early collections - The Names and Faces of Heroes and Permanent Errors - as well as more than two dozen new stories that have never been gathered together before.In his introduction, Mr. Price explains how, after the publication of his first two collections, he wrote no new stories for almost twenty years. ""But once I needed - for unknown reasons in a new and radically altered life - to return to the story, it opened before me like a new chance...A collection like this then,"" he adds, ""...will show a writer's pre-occupations in ways the novel severely rations (novels are partly made for that purpose - the release from self, long flights through the Other). John Keats's assertion that 'the excellence of every Art is its intensity' has served as a license and standard for me. From the start my stories were driven by heat - passion and mystery, often passion for the mystery I've found in particular rooms and spaces and the people they threaten or shelter - and my general aim is the transfer of a spell of keen witness, perceived by the reader as warranted in character and act.""There is, indeed, much for the reader to ""witness"" here of passion and mystery, of character and act. And the variety of stories - many of them set in Reynolds Price's native North Carolina, but a surprising number set in distant parts: Jerusalem in ""An Early Christmas,"" the American Southwest in ""Walking Lessons,"" and a number in Europe - will astonish even his most devoted readers. In short, The Collected Stories of Reynolds Price is as deeply rewarding a book as any he has yet published."; Fiction , Short Stories (single author);Scribner;6.24;June;1993

The Whole Shebang: A State-of-the-Universe(s) Report;By Ferris, Timothy;"From the world-acclaimed author of Coming of Age in the Milky Way comes this delightfully engrossing, comprehensive, and comprehensible report on how science today envisions the universe as a whole.Timothy Ferris begins The Whole Shebang with a succinct account of how we have come to know what we know about the universe. Then he explains the meaning behind the exciting new developments that have put cosmology in the headlines -- including the discovery of planets orbiting stars other than our sun, glimpses through the Hubble Space Telescope of how the universe looked when it was only a fraction of its present age, and the detection of structure in relic radiation from the big bang that may hint at the mechanisms of genesis.Ferris provides a lucid, nontechnical overview of current research and a forecast of where cosmological theory is likely to go in the twenty-first century. A master analogist, he presents accessible explanations of relativity and quantum physics, ""inflationary"" models indicating that the universe is much larger than had been thought, and ""string"" theories that portray all matter as made of space.The centerpiece of The Whole Shebang is a visionary account of near-future science, in which light is shed on the possibility that our universe is one among many universes, each with different physical laws and differing prospects for the emergence of life.The Whole Shebang explores questions that have occurred to even casual readers who are curious about nature on the largest scales: What does it mean to say that the universe is ""expanding,"" or that space is ""curved""? How could there have been an ""origin"" of the universe; what happened ""before""? Why is quantum uncertainty so puzzling to many scientists, and why do some regard it as one of theWritten with the literary flair that earned Ferris the accolade ""the greatest science writer in the world,"" The Whole Shebang interweaves probing scientific explication, lyrical descriptions, and finely honed profiles of the lives and personalities of the scientists and philosophers who have contributed to human understanding of the cosmos. Above all, it demonstrates that for all its abstractions, cosmology -- the scientific study of the universe as a whole -- is a very human activity whose theories and observations must ultimately answer to the human mind."; Science , Cosmology;Simon & Schuster, Inc.;8.29;January;1997

And he always stresses that good food -- and the good feeling it engenders at the table -- is not only a delight but also necessary to our well being so that eating for health means enjoyable eating.Eating Well for Optimum Health is a hugely practical and inspiring book about food, diet and nutrition that stands to change -- for the better and the healthier -- our most fundamental ideas about eating.; Health & Fitness , Diet & Nutrition , Nutrition;William Morrow Paperbacks;4.99;March;2001

Lines in the Sand: Desert Storm and the Remaking of the Arab World;By Amos, Deborah;"For many Americans, the Gulf War served as an introduction to a part of the world about which they knew virtually nothing. It provided a kind of mass-marketed crash course in Middle Eastern politics, tradition, and history.But what did they learn?In Lines in the Sand, veteran Middle East journalist Deborah Amos provides a unique perspective on the war, looking beyond the stories that were reported over and over to get at the truth about the events that led up to the conflict, and to examine a year later the effects it had on the people of the region.Among the issues she explores are how America armed Hussein, providing him with much of the power and expertise he demonstrated in overrunning Kuwait; how the collapse of the Soviet Union led to dramatic changes in U.S. policy toward Iraq, which the Americans had supported in its long war with Iran; how the rich Arabs of the Gulf states found a common strategy with their poorer neighbors; how the PLO, forced to deal with an intra-Arab conflict that included Israeli influence on one side, came to support Hussein; how Saudi domestic policies affected U.S. military strategies how the burgeoning resistance movement in Kuwait was crushed after the war; and, how, despite the war and the upheaval among so many nations, very little of substance has truly changed.Deborah Amos brings a fresh perspective to the war, with new insights into the region's history and culture. She explores the volatility of the region and concludes that it is as unstable now as before. Most significantly, she looks at the war not just from a U.S. perspective, but from the point of view of Kuwait, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Syria.Lines in the Sand is dramatic war reporting at its best, by a top female journalist covering the first war in which the American military put women on the frontlines--and, ironically, from a place in which women aren't even allowed to drive."; History , General;Simon & Schuster;5.51;July;1992

The Courage to Be Rich: Creating a Life of Material and Spiritual Abundance;By Orman, Suze;"""What would it take for you to change the course of your life?"" reads the first sentence of The Courage to Be Rich, a book that goes beyond the phenomenal success of The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom in challenging and inspiring us to realize our full financial potential, and to realize as well that the bottom line of life is comprised of much more than money. Why does it take courage to be rich? Because it takes courage to meet every obstacle and opportunity of life, to forgive ourselves and others for past mistakes, to imagine and achieve a future rich with possibility.   With her signature blend of inspirational and practical advice, Suze Orman asks us to look within, asserting her powerful conviction that once we achieve a state of emotional clarity regarding money, financial clarity will always follow. She guides us through a lifetime of financial issues, from relationships and prenuptial agreements to investment options, from the money we spend in daily life to the money we need for tomorrow. Finally, Suze takes on the seldom-explored subject of money and grace, the rewards it bestows and the responsibilities it confers.   Suze Orman may be the only financial planner for whom words like ""hope,"" ""acceptance,"" and ""courage"" are part of her daily lexicon. The Courage to Be Rich is a book that will change our very definitions of wealth and abundance."; Business & Economics , Personal Finance , Taxation;Riverhead Hardcover;4.99;March;1999

Basic Principles of Classical Ballet;By Vaganova, A. Ia.;Although the stars of Russian ballet Anna Pavlova and Tamara Karsavina possessed a national manner of dancing, there was no truly Russian school of dancing until the 1930s. The development of this school was largely due to Mme. Vaganova (1879–1951), not only a great dancer but also the teacher of Galina Ulanova and many others and an unsurpassed theoretician.The principles of Vaganova's system are presented in this well-known book. Mme. Vaganova's aim of creating a personal approach to the Russian dance was based on the critical assimilation of the experience of her contemporaries. Her ability to choose the best of what had been accomplished in the various ballet traditions (French, Italian, and Russian) and combine these into a unified teaching practice in itself amounted to a new school of dance. She firmly believed that the teaching process should be a planned exercise, ever changing with innovations in the dance. She sought from her pupils emotional expressiveness, strictness of form, a resolute, energetic manner of performance, and the understanding of the underlying coordination of movements.Her book discusses all basic principles of ballet, grouping movements by fundamental types. Chapters cover battements, rotary movements of the legs, the arms, poses of the classical dance, connecting and auxiliary movements, jumps, beats, point work, and turns as well as material for a sample lesson. Diagrams show clearly the exact foot, leg, arm, and body positions for the proper execution of many steps and movements. The result is a fundamental theory of dance that offers dancers, teachers, and ballet lovers information often difficult to locate in other books. 118 illustrations.; Performing Arts , Dance , Classical & Ballet;Dover Publications;4.99;June;1969

The Language of Life: A Festival of Poets;By Moyers, Bill D., Grubin, David, and Haba, James;"""Poets live the lives all of us live,"" says Bill Moyers, ""with one big difference. They have the power--the power of the word--to create a world of thoughts and emotions other can share. We only have to learn to listen.""In a series of fascinating conversations with thirty-four American poets, The Language Of Life celebrates language in its ""most exalted, wrenching, delighted, and concentrated form,"" and its unique power to re-create the human experience: falling in love, facing death, leaving home, playing basketball, losing faith, finding God. Listening to Linda McCarriston's award-winning poems about a child trapped in a violent home, or to Jimmy Santiago Baca explaining how words changed his life in prison, or to David Mura describing his Japanese American grandfather's experience in relocation camps, or to Sekou Sundiata stitching the magic of his childhood church in Harlem to the African tradition of storytelling, or to Gary Snyder invoking the natural wonder of mountains and rivers, or to Adrienne Rich calling for honesty in human relations, all testify to the necessity and clarity of the poet's voice, and all give hope that from such a wide variety of racial, ethnic, and religious threads we might yet weave a new American fabric.""'Listen,' said the storytellers of old, 'listen and you shall hear,'"" explains Bill Moyers.

What was it like playing baseball with a father as manager and a brother as a double-play combination? How did his father's firing and his brother's trade affect him? What made him choose the strike over the Streak?; Sports & Recreation , Baseball , General;St Martins Pr;4.99;September;1995
The Only Way I Know;By Ripken, Cal, Jr. and Bryan, Mike;"He says it's no big deal - he simply shows up for his job every day, just like millions of other working people. But when Baltimore Orioles shortstop Cal Ripken, Jr., reported to the baseball field on September 6, 1995, for a record-breaking 2,131st consecutive time, Americans felt otherwise. In an era of big-money sports, strikes, and grandstanding, the hardest-working ballplayer in the world had single-handedly put the ""great"" back in America's greatest game.Now, with the candor and grace that have endeared him to fans, Ripken tells the story of his journey to that moment and beyond.Best of all, Cal takes us inside the brain of one of the game's smartest players. He dissects the dedication to craft it takes to be a shortstop - especially when you're six-foot-four. He takes us through his strategies at the plate and in the field, his attention to the tiniest detail of positioning, or glove selection, or batting stance. It's a private lesson with one of the true masters of the art of playing baseball.Cal Ripken knows what it means to make a commitment, like the one he's made to his hometown and its team for his whole career, and to his own family. In this rich and rewarding memoir, we find out why he gives back as much as he takes from the game and the fans - it's the only way he knows."; Biography & Autobiography , Sports;Viking Adult;4.99;May;1997

Let Freedom Ring: Winning the War of Liberty over Liberalism;By Hannity, Sean;"As Americans, we face two fundamental questions:First, are we truly prepared to fight this new war to wipe out terrorism and terrorist regimes, and win it decisively -- no matter what sacrifices it requires or how long it takes?Second, are we once again prepared to teach our children the fundamental principles and values that make this country great -- the values that make this country worth fighting for, living for, and dying for?Sean Hannity is the hottest new phenomenon in TV and talk radio today. His gutsy, take-no-prisoners interviews and commentary on the Fox News Channel's Hannity & Colmes have made him one of cable television's most popular personalities. And his ascendance to the top of the talk radio world with ABC Radio's The Sean Hannity Show has won him a huge and devoted following that includes not only conservatives but anyone else who values straight talk over pandering and excuses.Now, in Let Freedom Ring, Sean Hannity offers a survey of the world -- political, social, and cultural -- as he sees it. Devoting special attention to 9/11, the war on terror, and the continuing threat we face at home and abroad, he makes clear that the greatest challenge we have to overcome may not be an attack from overseas, but the slow compromising of our national character. And he asks why, particularly in this time of war, should we entrust our future to the voices of the Left -- the very people who have spent decades ravaging so many of our core values and traditions?Our nation, as Hannity reminds us, was founded on the idea of freedom. And in order to protect our freedoms, he argues, we must stand vigilant against liberal attempts to compromise our strengths. From our military and intelligence forces, to our borders and airports, to our unified commitment to root out terrorists at home and abroad, he reveals how our strongest lines of defense have come under attack -- by left-wing voices within our government, media, schools, and elsewhere. And he shows how even domestic issues like taxation, education, patriotism, and the family have been exploited by liberals with their own agendas -- with potentially disastrous results.Filled with the commonsense commentary and passionate argument that have made Sean Hannity the most compelling conservative voice since Rush Limbaugh, Let Freedom Ring is an urgent call to arms. For, as Hannity warns, ""We are engaged in a war of ideas. And civilization is at stake."""; Political Science , Terrorism;William Morrow Paperbacks;4.99;February;2004
Hamlet (Oxford World's Classics);By Shakespeare, William and Hibbard, G. R.

""You must be able to dance if you are to heal people,""he admonished the young doctor.""I can teach you my steps, but you will have to hear your own music.""Hammerschlag synthesizes his Jewish heritage with his experience with Native Americans to produce a practice open to all methods of healing.

Managing Transitions: Making The Most Of Change;By Bridges, William;"Every day the newspapers report more corporate mergers and restructuring. Every day thousands of lives are altered by these changes. Most managers and employees, however, do not have the experience to effectively work through such transitions. In Managing Transitions, William Bridges provides a clear understanding of what change does to employees and what employees in transition can do to an organization, and he shows how to minimize the distress and disruptions caused by change.Directed at managers and employees in today&#39;s corporations, where change is necessary to revitalize and improve corporate performance, Managing Transitions  addresses the fact that it is people who have to carry out the change. It not only talks about what should be done, but also shows how to do it, giving managers practical ways to bring the people ”on board.” Armed with this new information, managers will look at future changes in a new way, no longer feeling anxious and hopeless, but rather looking at opportunities.Everybody talks about ”managing change” and ”resistance to change,” but Bridges is the first to talk about what is going on inside the people who have to make the change work. He is the first to provide any real sense of the emotional impact of change and what can be done to keep it from disrupting the entire organization. Bridges&#39;s years of experience helping organizations and individuals successfully take control of change has proven the need for specific, concrete guidelines for dealing with change.  Managing Transitions provides these guidelines."; Business & Economics , Management;Da Capo Lifelong Books;4.99;September;1991

Mortgaging The Earth: The World Bank, Environmental Impoverishment, and the Crisis of Development;By Rich, Bruce;The World Bank is the single biggest source of finance for international development, and its policies have a critical impact on the future of more than 110 borrowing countries. In this dramatic and lively new critique, Bruce Rich, internationally known expert on the environment and the World Bank, analyzes how the Bank has become a seemingly unstoppable and often destructive environmental and political force.The author chronicles the life-and-death impact of Bank-funded projects around the world: huge dams that have forced the resettlement of millions of the poorest people on earth, road building and jungle colonization schemes in Brazil, Indonesia, and Africa that have left vast deforestation and social conflict in their wake, and much more. Rich also recounts the bold grassroots campaigns of nongovernmental groups seeking alternatives to Bank-style development.Confidential internal Bank documents expose chronic misrepresentations by Bank management to its donor nations and to the public. Rich reveals how senior officials continue to push money into projects with disastrous ecological and human rights consequences, despite early and persistent protests of Bank staff. He shows how repeatedly and without political accountability the Bank has increased its support for regimes that torture and murder their subjects, from Ceaucescu's Romania to Suharto's Indonesia.Mortgaging the Earth explains the so-called pressure to lend that emerges as a leitmotif in the Bank's fifty-year history and shows how this institutional dynamic has taken on a damaging life of its own. Rich traces the history of the Bank, from its inception at Bretton Woods, where it was conceived as a way to funnel reconstruction loans for war-torn Europe, through the surreally top-down tenure of Robert McNamara to the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit. At Rio, governments poured billions of dollars more into the Bank to save our global environment - while the Bank financed new ecological disasters.The World Bank, Rich demonstrates in a provocative history of development from Descartes to Max Weber to Chico Mendes, is a crucible of the goals of the modern age, goals that in the very moment of their worldwide triumph have become problematic. He shows how the Bank's dilemmas mirror our global civilization's crisis of values and gives expert prescription for reform.Mortgaging the Earth makes disturbingly clear why every American should be concerned about the World Bank, as a critical arena where the global politics of technology, development, and the environment are played out on a small planet, one where the stakes are increasingly for keeps.; Science , Environmental Science;Beacon Pr;5.64;February;1994

Life in Ancient Egypt;By Erman, Adolf;What was it like to live in the ancient land watered by the Nile, thousands of years before Christ was born? How did a man earn his living, what did he wear, where did he go in his leisure time? What was the relationship between an ordinary Egyptian and his government, his wife, his children? Was life for him grim or optimistic, difficult or easy, reverent or worldly? Did his people travel, explore, conquer? Were they very much different from those of the other great civilizations of antiquity, the Greek and the Roman? What was the nature of their science, art, magic, religion? If the past has lessons for the present, what can we deduce from ancient Egyptian life that is of value to us today?For generations, scholar, specialists, and general readers have been turning to a monumental sourcebook for the answers to such questions: Life in Ancient Egypt by Adolf Erman. It is one of the most influential and frequently consulted works on Egyptology ever written, a classic in its field and the basis of numerous other studies and works. It is still one of a very few books that offer the modern reader so satisfying, informative, and complete a survey in one volume.Erman, a rigorously trained scholar, Director of the Egyptian Museum in Berlin, and author of standard works on Egyptology, covers his subject thoroughly and with a wealth of interesting, concrete detail. He examines ancient Egypt’s political structure, crime and police systems, domestic life and kinships, dress, amusements, religion, learning, mathematics, magic and folk beliefs, literature, art, agriculture, trades, arts and crafts, commerce, warfare, and much else. His objective point of view, eschewing romanticism on the one hand and frigid pedantry on the other, gives us a treatment that is as trustworthy in fact as it is evocative in effect — as Professor Jon Manchip White says in his new introduction for this edition, “From first to last … a superb performance.” The scholar, the student and the merely curious can do no better than to go to this first, great authority on ancient Egypt.

Three Gospels;By Price, Reynolds (EDT);"A decade after he published his famous first novel, A Long and Happy Life, Reynolds Price began a serious study of the Hebrew and Greek narratives which combine to form that crucial document of Western civilization we call the Bible. Since early childhood, Price had known Bible stories of patriarchs, kings, prophets, and the boldly assertive women of Ancient Israel, as well as the four-fold gospel story of the life of Jesus -- another Jew whose career has exerted immense fascination on subsequent history.  In Price's early middle age, however, he felt compelled to go further than simple reading; he began to investigate the rudiments of the Bible stories as deeply as possible. He focused on the Hebrew and Greek originals that are unquestionably the most discussed and annotated texts with the close assistance of other literal versions and of numerous scholarly commentaries, old and modern. He was likewise encouraged and helped by frequent discussions with distinguished scholar-colleagues at Duke University, where he has taught since 1958.  As the work continued over several years, Price expanded his translation attempts into the Greek New Testament. And soon he had begun an informal navigation of the shoals of Koine Greek -- that common Mediterranean dialect in which a good deal of the business of the Roman empire was conducted and in which the gospels and all other books of the New Testament were written. Gradually, his translations of separate incidents from the four gospels evolved into a literal translation of the whole of the oldest gospel, Mark. His first version of Mark appeared, along with other translations from the Old and New Testaments, in A Palpable God (Atheneum, 1978). The book met with a wide and favorable reception from scholars, writers, and critics.  Price's studies have expanded steadily in the intervening decades; and in recent years he has worked at both a revised version of his early translation of Mark and an entirely new literal version of the Gospel of John (John is the lastpublished gospel and almost surely the one that comes, at its core, from an eyewitness of the life of Jesus). To his new translations, Price has added extensive prefaces, which he hopes will be of interest to scholars and casual readers alike. The prefaces are the result not only of his own work as a translator and his discussions with New Testament scholars of more than twenty years reading in textual exegesis, in the life of the first-century Roman world (including the immensely complicated realities of Roman Palestine), but also in consideration of thewidespread and ongoing attempt to reconsider the historical bases of our knowledge of Jesus.  Finally, after twice teaching a semester-long seminar on the gospels of Mark and John at Duke University, Price has written a gospel of his own. The new gospel, which he calls ""apocryphal"" in a non-canonical sense, makes a fresh attempt at a compact narrative of the life and work of Jesus. Yet it is an attempt grounded meticulously in the earliest available historic, biographical, and theological evidence. In a third and final preface, Price describes the motive for writing a gospel of his own. In brief, his new gospel (like the whole of Three Gospels) aims to render the highest possible contemporaryjustice to a life lived two thousand years ago, a life presented in -- and, to a startling extent, still recoverable from -- documents that have proved the most influential in Western history."; Religion , Biblical Studies , General;Scribner;5.29;May;1996

Doing It;By Burgess, Melvin;"I mean-I like girls. I get on well with them. And I like sex.

The Tiananmen Papers : The Chinese Leadership's Decision to Use Force Against Their Own People - In Their Own Words;By Liang, Zhang (COM), Nathan, Andrew J. (EDT), Link, Perry (EDT), Nathan, Andrew J., Zhang, Liang, Link, E. Perry (EDT), Zhang, Liang (EDT), Link, E. Perry, and Liang, Zhang;"On the night of June 3-4, 1989, Chinese troops violently crushed the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the communist regime. In this extraordinary collection of hundreds of internal government and Communist Party documents, secretly smuggled out of China, we learn how these events came to pass from behind the scenes. The material reveals how the most important decisions were made; and how the turmoil split the ruling elite into radically opposed factions. The book includes the minutes of the crucial meetings at which the Elders decided to cashier the pro-reform Party secretary Zhao Ziyang and to replace him with Jiang Zemin, to declare martial law, and finally to send the troops to drive the students from the Square.Just as the Pentagon Papers laid bare the secret American decision making behind the Vietnam War and changed forever our view of the nation's political leaders, so too has The Tiananmen Papers altered our perception of how and why the events of June 4 took the shape they did.

Money Harmony: Resolving Money Conflicts in Your Life and Relationships;By Mellan, Olivia;"""For most of us, money is never just money,"" writes Olivia Mellan. It can also represent love, power, happiness, security, self-esteem, and so much more. As a result, we have intense feelings about money - feelings we often hide from - which prevent us from dealing with it productively, and which make it a primary source of anxiety and conflict in our lives and relationships.Olivia Mellan knows how to help individuals and couples resolve their money conflicts. In Money Harmony, she presents the innovative program she has successfully used for more than a decade in her private practice and in workshops and seminars nationwide. Her reassuring, positive approach gives readers insight through real-life examples and conversations and self-knowledge exercises; teaches readers how to evaluate the impact of childhood experiences on their current money attitudes and behaviors; demystifies the common myths about money that can lead to extreme actions, running the gamut from overspending to avoidance to hoarding; and explains the strengths and weaknesses of various money personality styles, allowing readers to come to terms, comfortably, with their own styles.The second half of Money Harmony is devoted to couples, whose hidden money agendas and often opposing styles can cause conflict. Mellan offers a variety of proven communication techniques: dynamic activities and creative ""moneytalks"" that teach couples how to appreciate and respect differing styles, to resolve simple and complex money conflicts, and to set individual and joint goals. For anyone whose life or relationship is affected by money, Money Harmony is essential reading."; Family & Relationships , General;Walker & Co;16.49;May;1994
Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?:  Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround;By Gerstner, Louis V., Jr.;"In 1990, IBM had its most profitable year ever. By 1993, the computer industry had changed so rapidly the company was on its way to losing $16 billion and IBM was on a watch list for extinction -- victimized by its own lumbering size, an insular corporate culture, and the PC era IBM had itself helped invent.Then Lou Gerstner was brought in to run IBM. Almost everyone watching the rapid demise of this American icon presumed Gerstner had joined IBM to preside over its continued dissolution into a confederation of autonomous business units. This strategy, well underway when he arrived, would have effectively eliminated the corporation that had invented many of the industry's most important technologies.Instead, Gerstner took hold of the company and demanded the managers work together to re-establish IBM's mission as a customer-focused provider of computing solutions. Moving ahead of his critics, Gerstner made the hold decision to keep the company together, slash prices on his core product to keep the company competitive, and almost defiantly announced, ""The last thing IBM needs right now is a vision.""Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? tells the story of IBM's competitive and cultural transformation. In his own words, Gerstner offers a blow-by-blow account of his arrival at the company and his campaign to rebuild the leadership team and give the workforce a renewed sense of purpose. In the process, Gerstner defined a strategy for the computing giant and remade the ossified culture bred by the company's own success.The first-hand story of an extraordinary turnaround, a unique case study in managing a crisis, and a thoughtful reflection on the computer industry and the principles of leadership, Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? sums up Lou Gerstner's historic business achievement. Taking readers deep into the world of IBM's CEO, Gerstner recounts the high-level meetings and explains the pressure-filled, no-turning-back decisions that had to be made. He also offers his hard-won conclusions about the essence of what makes a great company run.In the history of modern business, many companies have gone from being industry leaders to the verge of extinction. Through the heroic efforts of a new management team, some of those companies have even succeeded in resuscitating themselves and living on in the shadow of their former stature. But only one company has been at the pinnacle of an industry, fallen to near collapse, and then, beyond anyone's expectations, returned to set the agenda. That company is IBM.Lou Gerstener, Jr., served as chairman and chief executive officer of IBM from April 1993 to March 2002, when he retired as CEO. He remained chairman of the board through the end of 2002. Before joining IBM, Mr. Gerstner served for four years as chairman and CEO of RJR Nabisco, Inc. This was preceded by an eleven-year career at the American Express Company, where he was president of the parent company and chairman and CEO of its largest subsidiary. Prior to that, Mr. Gerstner was a director of the management consulting firm of McKinsey & Co., Inc.

American Artists On Art: From 1940 To 1980 (Icon Editions);By Johnson, Ellen H. (EDT);"From the Preface:The fact that so much of modern art has devoted itself to the exploration and assertion of its own identity is reflected in, but does not explain, the increasing amount of writing and talking on the part of contemporary artists. Rather, the whole history of the changing role of art and artists in a democratic, industrial, and technological society stands behind the spate of artists' words and the public's hunger for them?even some of the general public out there beyond art's little circle. Statements by artists appeal somewhat the way drawings do: they bring us, or at least they hold the promise of bringing us, closer to the artist's thoughts and feelings and to an understanding of his or her modus operandi; they hold the keys to a mysterious realm. And sometimes they offer us the sheer pleasure of good reading. Such is the primary raison d'?e of this book.Its other motivation is educational, and stems from the frustrating lack, in teaching contemporary art, of any single compilation of statements by American artists from 1940 to the present.? This anthology differs in several respects from those others that do include documents of American art since 1940.? The selection I have made is devoted exclusively to statements of artists; it is limited to the last four decades; it presents in a single volume a representative and fairly comprehensive coverage of major developments in American art beginning with Abstract Expressionism; and, whenever possible, it cities the first, or among the very earliest, documents signalizing a shift in the definition, intent, or direction of art.?"; Art , Criticism & Theory;Routledge;5.29;August;1982

The Princess Test (Princess Tales);By Andersen, Hans Christian, Levine, Gail Carson, Elliott, Mark (ILT), and Elliott, Mark;Gail Carson Levine charmed the world with Ella Enchanted, her spirited retelling of the Cinderella story. Now this award-winning author turns her attention to two more classic fairy tales, and deftly turns them upside down and inside out with her trademark wit and hilarity. In The Fairy's Mistake, two very different sisters have two very different encounters with the fairy Ethelinda. Rosella is kind and helpful. Her reward: Jewels and gems tumble out of her mouth whenever she speaks. Myrtle is rude and spiteful. Her punishment: Bugs and vipers slither out of her mouth. The fairy Ethelinda feels she's meted out justice just right--until she discovers Rosella has been locked up by a greedy prince and Myrtle is having the time of her life!  In The Princess Test, King Humphrey has decided its time for his son, Prince Nicholas, to marry. But he must make sure the bride is a real princess. So he devises a series of princess tests, designed to weed out the phonies and the fakes. Meanwhile, Nicholas has fallen in love with Lorelei, a mere blacksmith's daughter. She's no princess, but he wants to marry her all the same--but how will she ever pass the terrible tests?In these first two delightfully entertaining, laugh-out-loud Princess Tales, Gail Levine gently spoofs the notion that fairies are always right and that tests can never prove a persons worth, but holds fast to the notion that true love will always win in the end.; Juvenile Fiction , Royalty;HarperCollins;10.99;March;1999

Endangered Pleasures: In Defense of Naps, Bacon, Martinis, Profanity, and Other Indulgences;By Holland, Barbara;Here is a refreshing look at life as it ought to be.  Bare feet, gardening, dawdling over the newspaper, oversleeping, and idle summer vacations are infinitely more satisfying than counting fat grams, eating only vegetables, and sitting behind that desk every day.  So toss out the guilt and rebel.  Don't just stop and smell the flowers--call in sick and lie among them, preferably with a good friend, a bottle of wine, and a handful of chocolates.  Endangered Pleasures is a delightful reminder that rest and relaxation are more rewarding than a job performance review.  After all, life's too short.

The Closing of the American Mind;By Bloom, Allan;THE BRILLIANT AND CONTROVERSIAL CRITIQUE OF AMERICAN CULTURE WITH NEARLY A MILLION COPIES IN PRINT  In 1987, eminent political philosopher Allan Bloom published The Closing of the American Mind, an appraisal of contemporary America that “hits with the approximate force and effect of electroshock therapy” (The New York Times) and has not only been vindicated, but has also become more urgent today. In clear, spirited prose, Bloom argues that the social and political crises of contemporary America are part of a larger intellectual crisis: the result of a dangerous narrowing of curiosity and exploration by the university elites. Now, in this twenty-fifth anniversary edition, acclaimed author and journalist Andrew Ferguson contributes a new essay that describes why Bloom’s argument caused such a furor at publication and why our culture so deeply resists its truths today.; Social Science , General;Simon & Schuster;4.99;May;1988

Ain't You Glad You Joined the Republicans?: A Short History of the Gop;By Batchelor, John Calvin;"John Calvin Batchelor's ""Ain't You Glad You Joined the Republicans?"" (Abraham Lincoln's 1860 campaign slogan) is the truth, and nothing but the unbelievable truth, of the Grand Old Party of the Republic. Born in the cataclysm of the antislavery movement, the Republican Party was from the first - and remains today - the most successful revolutionary party in the history of democracy. And the Party's story - from Lincoln to Teddy Roosevelt to Nixon, Reagan, and Gingrich - is the pageant of American politics.Using primary sources long overlooked by traditional historians and employing a novelist's eye and ear for the telling detail, Batchelor, in his sweeping narrative, encompasses one and a half centuries of Republican battle and paradox."; Political Science , General;Henry Holt & Co;5.76;May;1996

Don't Know Much About the Bible: Everything You Need to Know About the Good Book but Never Learned;By Davis, Kenneth C.;"Nine out of ten Americans own a Bible, but how much do they know about the one book that has influenced human history more than any other? Don't Know Much About the Bible by New York Times bestselling author Kenneth C. Davis is designed to illuminate everything we need to know about the Good Book but never learned.With wit, authority, and intelligence, Davis brings the world of the Old and New Testaments to vivid life, setting the panorama of the Scriptures against the historical events that shaped them; clearing up misconceptions and mistranslations; summarizing Bible stories, parables, and miracles; and adding fresh new insights to the world's most owned, least understood book.Davis is uniquely qualified for the assignment. The creator of the bestselling Don't Know Much About series, which has more than 1.6 million copies in print, he now illuminates the bestselling book of all time using his inimitable question-and-answer approach and providing a key to the people, places, and ""household names"" we need to unlock ""The Greatest Story Ever Told.""Relying on up-to-date research and improved translations, Davis set out to uncover what the Bible says -- and doesn't say. Don't Know Much About the Bible is the result of his efforts and includes the following observations: There are two different Creation stories told in Genesis, but no apple in the Garden of Eden story. Noah invented wine and cursed the son who had seen him drunk and naked. There was no ""coat of many colors"" in the story of Joseph and his jealous brothers, but rather a long-sleeved robe. Moses didn't write the Torah and he didn't part the Red Sea in his escape from Pharaoh. The Sixth Commandment does not condemn all killing. Jericho's walls may have tumbled down because the city lies on a fault line. King David probably didn't kill Goliath and didn't write the Psalms."; Religion , Biblical Studies , General;William Morrow;8.79;September;1998

Language and Myth;By Cassirer, Ernst;"In this important study Ernst Cassirer analyzes the non-rational thought processes that go to make up culture. He demonstrates that beneath both language and myth there lies an unconscious ""grammar"" of experience, whose categories and canons are not those of logical thought. He shows that this prelogical ""logic"" is not merely an undeveloped state of rationality, but something basically different, and that this archaic mode of thought still has enormous power over even our most rigorous thought, in language, poetry and myth.The author analyzes brilliantly such seemingly diverse (yet related) phenomena as the metaphysics of the Bhagavat Gita, the Melanesian concept of Mana, the Naturphilosophie of Schelling, modern poetry, Ancient Egyptian religion, and symbolic logic. He covers a vast range of material that is all too often neglected in studies of human thought.These six essays are of great interest to the student of philosophy or the philosophy of science, the historian, or the anthropologist. They are also remarkably timely for students of literature, what with the enormous emphasis placed upon ""myth"" in modern literary speculation. This book is not superficial speculation by a dabbler, but a penetrating study by one of the most profound and sensitive philosophic minds of our time."; Philosophy , Religious;Dover Publications;14.62;June;1953

The Last Debate:  A Novel of Politics and Journalism;By Lehrer, James, Smith, Peter (EDT), and Osnos, Peter;Tom Chapman's reporting begins innocently enough. It's the eve of the one and only presidential debate, and he's been sent to Colonial Williamsburg by his magazine, The New American Tatler, to cover the event. An important assignment, but pretty routine for a journalist of Chapman's abilities.The campaign itself, however, has been anything but routine. The American people face an impossible choice between apparent evil and apparent incompetence: The Republican candidate, David Donald Meredith, a handsome, charismatic figure and a riveting speaker, is a fundamentalist demagogue, a nativist, and probably a racist - none but the most fervent ideologues doubts that his election would tear the country apart. The Democrat, Paul L. Greene, is everything Meredith is not - liberal, earnest, and utterly colorless - and is so far behind in the polls that he has all but conceded the race weeks before the election.As the handlers, the press corps, the camera crews, and the campaign operators assemble in Williamsburg for the final battle of the campaign, a different sort of battle is taking place on the debate panel. Reporters have been given devastating anonymous reports about Meredith's personal life. There's no time to check them out, but using them could throw the election to Greene. In utter secrecy, a decision is made. By the time the debate is over, American politics and journalism have been changed forever and the four panelists have vaulted to mega-stardom. And Tom Chapman is hot on the trail of the biggest story of his career: the debate behind the last debate.; Fiction , Political;Random House;4.99;August;1995

ROLLING THUNDER: Jet Combat From WW II to the Gulf War;By Rendall, Ivan;"""The jet fighter is one of the great icons of the second half of the twentieth century, a symbol of achievement, of technical excellence, of ultimate modernity, of latent military power.""  So begins Ivan Rendall, a former Royal Air Force pilot, in this thrilling first-ever history of the most seductive and deadly of all of man's weapons of war. From its birth in battle during the last days of World War II to its current aeronautical peak, the jet fighter has always been the king of the sky. Rendall's Rolling Thunder is the celebration of a machine, and a culture, for which ""winning is about accepting that there is no such thing as second-best.""  Rendall's scrupulous history is driven by a strong thesis: jets may depend upon technological advances, but the human edge supplied by their pilots has determined their success or failure in all times and places. In this respect, the West has triumphed over its enemies. Beginning with the dangerously fast but hopelessly outnumbered German Me 262, jets and the men who flew them quickly became potent physical and psychological weapons. From the ruins of a defeated Germany came the now-familiar look of swept-back wings and with them the secret of supersonic flight. Less than a decade later, the two World War II allies most responsible for Germany's defeat would meet as enemies in Korea. Their planes -- the American F-86 Saber and Russian MiG-15 -- clashed over the Yalu River in what American pilots called ""MiG Alley."" Diving from 40,000 feet and flying through dry riverbeds so low that their engines kicked up dirt, both sides' machines soon proved their worth.  In Vietnam, American fighter pilots involved in the costly ""Rolling Thunder"" campaign again proved the value of the American emphasis on individualism as taught in the ""Top Gun"" school of aeronautics. Rendall vividly describes pilots in F-4 Phantoms and F-105 Thunderchiefs dodging SA-2 surface-to-air missiles in the ""ultimate test of man versus machine.""  Recent uses of air power, from the legendary ""Instant Thunder"" campaign in the Gulf War to the enforcement of No-Fly Zones in Bosnia, have proved that the jet fighter remains as versatile and dangerous as ever. But today, with $100 million mach 3 machines capable of climbing 65,000 feet -- twice the height of Everest -- in a minute, many have argued that the pilot has become the weak link in the jet fighter's lethal equation. Rendall shows that the argument to remove the pilot from his machine -- seemingly complete with NASA's new unmanned X-36 -- is as old as the machine that broke the sound barrier, Chuck Yeager's X-1. The ability to balance the grace and brutality of a machine that has evolved into a perfect combination of form and function will remain the unique province of the fighter pilot -- the ""quintessential warrior of our times."""; Technology & Engineering , Military Science;Free Press;5.41;May;1999

Young Men and Fire;By MacLean, Norman;"On August 5, 1949, a crew of fifteen of the United States Forest Service's elite airborne firefighters, the Smokejumpers, stepped into the sky above a remote forest fire in the Montana wilderness. Two hours after their jump, all but three of these men were dead or mortally burned. Haunted by these deaths for forty years, Norman Maclean puts back together the scattered pieces of the Mann Gulch tragedy.Young Men and Fire won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1992.""A magnificent drama of writing, a tragedy that pays tribute to the dead and offers rescue to the living.... Maclean's search for the truth, which becomes an exploration of his own mortality, is more compelling even than his journey into the heart of the fire. His description of the conflagration terrifies, but it is his battle with words, his effort to turn the story of the 13 men into tragedy that makes this book a classic.""—from New York Times Book Review Editor's Choice, Best Books of 1992""A treasure: part detective story, part western, part tragedy, part elegy and wholly eloquent ghost story in which the dead and the living join ranks cheerfully, if sometimes eerily, in a search for truth and the rest it brings.""—Joseph Coates, Chicago Tribune""An astonishing book. In compelling language, both homely and elegant, Young Men and Fire miraculously combines a fascinating primer on fires and firefighting, a powerful, breathtakingly real reconstruction of a tragedy, and a meditation on writing, grief and human character.... Maclean's last book will stir your heart and haunt your memory.""—Timothy Foote, USA Today""Beautiful.... A dark American idyll of which the language can be proud.""—Robert M. Adams, The New York Review of Books""Young Men and Fire is redolent of Melville. Just as the reader of Moby Dick comes to comprehend the monstrous entirety of the great white whale, so the reader of Young Men and Fire goes into the heart of the great red fire and comes out thoroughly informed. Don't hesitate to take the plunge.""—Dennis Drabelle, Washington Post Book World""Young Men and Fire is a somber and poetic retelling of a tragic event. It is the pinnacle of smokejumping literature and a classic work of 20th-century nonfiction.""—John Holkeboer, The Wall Street Journal""Maclean is always with the brave young dead. . . . They could not have found a storyteller with a better claim to represent their honor. . . . A great book.""—James R.

Let Freedom Ring: Winning the War of Liberty over Liberalism;By Hannity, Sean;"As Americans, we face two fundamental questions:First, are we truly prepared to fight this new war to wipe out terrorism and terrorist regimes, and win it decisively—no matter what sacrifices it requires or how long it takes?Second, are we once again prepared to teach our children the fundamental principles and values that make this country great—the values that make this country worth fighting for, living for, and dying for?Sean Hannity is the hottest new phenomenon in TV and talk radio today. His gutsy, take-no-prisoners interviews and commentary on the Fox News Channel's Hannity & Colmes have made him one of cable television's most popular personalities. And his ascendance to the top of the talk radio world with ABC Radio's The Sean Hannity Show has won him a huge and devoted following that includes not only conservatives but anyone else who values straight talk over pandering and excuses.Now, in Let Freedom Ring, Sean Hannity offers a survey of the world—political, social, and cultural—as he sees it. Devoting special attention to 9/11, the war on terror, and the continuing threat we face at home and abroad, he makes clear that the greatest challenge we have to overcome may not be an attack from overseas, but the slow compromising of our national character. And he asks why, particularly in this time of war, should we entrust our future to the voices of the Left—the very people who have spent decades ravaging so many of our core values and traditions?Our nation, as Hannity reminds us, was founded on the idea of freedom. And in order to protect our freedoms, he argues, we must stand vigilant against liberal attempts to compromise our strengths. From our military and intelligence forces, to our borders and airports, to our unified commitment to root out terrorists at home and abroad, he reveals how our strongest lines of defense have come under attack—by left-wing voices within our government, media, schools, and elsewhere. And he shows how even domestic issues like taxation, education, patriotism, and the family have been exploited by liberals with their own agendas—with potentially disastrous results.Filled with the commonsense commentary and passionate argument that have made Sean Hannity the most compelling conservative voice since Rush Limbaugh, Let Freedom Ring is an urgent call to arms. For, as Hannity warns, ""We are engaged in a war of ideas. And civilization is at stake."""; Political Science , Terrorism;William Morrow;4.99;August;2002
When All Hell Breaks Loose;By Spencer, Camika;"It's a Sunday morning, and while most people are thinking about getting the paper and breakfast, Gregory Alston has something other than eggs on his mind.  Today he's going to propose to Adrian Jenkins, his girlfriend of three years.  But when he actually does, all hell breaks loose and he gets a lot more than he bargained for.  His mother returns from France, where she's been living as a jazz singer since leaving her family in Texas nearly twenty years ago.  His Holy Roller sister, Shreese, complains that Adrian is too ""worldly"" for him, even though she herself is falling for the shady, charismatic pastor of her church.  And his boys-who run the gamut from player to buffoon-react to the news of his engagement with grief and disbelief. And if that's not enough, he's got Adrian, who has more skeletons in her closet than a haunted house.  What's a brother to do? When All Hell Breaks Loose is a debut novel about black twenty-somethings that is fast and funny.  It's also a peek into the minds of young black men.  Camika Spencer won't just have you laughing-she'll have you looking in the mirror to see if she's talking about you."; Fiction , Humorous , General;St. Martin's Griffin;5.29;October;2000
Gorgias (The Penguin Classics, L94);By Plato and Hamilton, Walter;Taking the form of a dialogue between Socrates, Gorgias, Polus and Callicles, the Gorgias debates crucial questions about the nature of government. While the aspiring politician Callicles propounds the view that might is right, and the rhetorician Gorgias argues that oratory and the power to persuade represent 'the greatest good', Socrates insists on the duty of politicians to consider the welfare of their citizens - a duty he believed had been dishonoured in the Athens of his time. The dialogue offers insights into how classical Athens was governed, as well as creating a theoretical framework that has been highly influential on subsequent political debate.; Philosophy , General;Viking Pr;5.29;June;1971

Freud's Wishful Dream Book;By Welsh, Alexander;"Although it is customary to credit Freud's self-analysis, it may be more accurate, Alexander Welsh argues, to say that psychoanalysis began when The Interpretation of Dreams was published in the last weeks of the nineteenth century. Only by going public with his theory--that dreams manifest hidden wishes--did Freud establish a position to defend and embark upon a career. That position and career have been among the most influential in this century. In August 1899, Freud wrote to Wilhelm Fliess of the dream book in terms reminiscent of Dante's Inferno. Beginning from a dark wood, this modern journey features ""a concealed pass though which I lead the reader--my specimen dream with its peculiarities, details, indiscretions, bad jokes--and then suddenly the high ground and the view and the question, Which way do you wish to go now?"" Physician that he is, Freud appoints himself guide rather than hero, yet the way ""you"" wish to go is very much his prescribed way. In Welsh's book, readers are invited on Freud's journey, to pause at each concealed pass in his seminal work and ask where the guide is taking them and why. Along the way, Welsh shows how Freud's arbitrary turnings are themselves wishful, intended to persuade by pleasing the reader and author alike; that his interest in secrets and his self-proclaimed modest ambition are products of their time; and that the book may best be read as a romance or serial comedy. ""Some of the humor throughout,"" Welsh notes, ""can only be understood as a particular kind of fine performance."" Welsh offers the first critical overview of the argument in Freud's masterpiece and of the author who presents himself as guide."; Literary Collections , American , General;Princeton University Press;18.0;September;1994

Holy War Inc. Inside the Secret World of Osama Bin Laden;By Bergen, Peter L.;"On September 11, 2001, the world in which we live was changed forever. The twin towers of the World Trade Center came crashing down, one side of the Pentagon burst into flame, and more than six thousand men, women, and children lost their lives in the most deadly terrorist attack on American soil. As shocking as it was, it had been long in the making: The assault was the most sophisticated and horrifying in a series of operations masterminded by Osama bin Laden and his Jihad group -- an organization that CNN's terrorism analyst Peter Bergen calls Holy War, Inc.  One of only a handful of Western journalists to have interviewed the world's most wanted man face to face, Peter Bergen has produced the definitive book on the Jihadist network that operates globally and in secrecy. In the course of four years of investigative reporting, he has interviewed scores of insiders -- from bin Laden associates and family members to Taliban leaders to CIA officials -- and traveled to Afghanistan, Yemen, Egypt, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom to learn the truth about bin Laden's al Queda organization and his mission.  Immense in scope and unnerving in its findings, Holy War, Inc. reveals:   How bin Laden lives, travels, and communicates with his ""cells."" How his role in the crushing defeat of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan made him a hero to Muslims all over the world -- and equipped him to endure a long and bloody siege. How the CIA ended up funding -- to the tune of three billion dollars -- radical, anti-American Afghan groups allied to bin Laden. How the attacks that foreshadowed the destruction of the World Trade Center -- among them the bombings of the American embassies in Africa and the warship USS Cole in Yemen -- were planned and executed. The dimensions of bin Laden's personal fortune, and why freezing his assets is both futile and nearly impossible. The ideology of bin Laden's number two, the man who has influenced him most profoundly in his holy war -- the Egyptian Ayman al Zawahiri. What we can expect from Islamist extremists in the future.   Above all, Peter Bergen helps us to see bin Laden's organization in a radically new light: as a veritable corporation that has exploited twenty-first-century communications and weapons technologies in the service of a medieval reading of the Koran and holy war. Holy War, Inc. is essential reading for anyone trying to understand tomorrow's terrorist threats and the militant Islamist movements that could determine the fate of governments -- and human lives -- the world over.  Both author and publisher will donate a portion of the proceeds from this book to United Way's September 11th Fund for the relief of victims of the World Trade Center attacks."; Political Science , International Relations , General;Free Press;4.99;November;2001

Worth the Fighting For: A Memoir;By McCain, John and Salter, Mark;"In 1999, John McCain wrote one of the most acclaimed and bestselling memoirs of the decade, Faith of My Fathers. That book ended in 1972, with McCain’s release from imprisonment in Vietnam. This is the rest of his story, about his great American journey from the U.S. Navy to his electrifying run for the presidency, interwoven with heartfelt portraits of the mavericks who have inspired him through the years—Ted Williams, Theodore Roosevelt, visionary aviation proponent Billy Mitchell, Marlon Brando in Viva Zapata!, and, most indelibly, Robert Jordan. It was Jordan, Hemingway’s protagonist in For Whom the Bell Tolls, who showed McCain the ideals of heroism and sacrifice, stoicism and redemption, and why certain causes, despite the costs, are . . .Worth the Fighting ForAfter five and a half years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, naval aviator John McCain returned home a changed man. Regaining his health and flight-eligibility status, he resumed his military career, commanding carrier pilots and serving as the navy’s liaison to what is sometimes ironically called the world’s most exclusive club, the United States Senate. Accompanying Senators John Tower and Henry “Scoop” Jackson on international trips, McCain began his political education in the company of two masters, leaders whose standards he would strive to maintain upon his election to the U.S. Congress. There, he learned valuable lessons in cooperation from a good-humored congressman from the other party, Morris Udall. In 1986, McCain was elected to the U.S. Senate, inheriting the seat of another role model, Barry Goldwater.During his time in public office, McCain has seen acts of principle and acts of craven self-interest. He describes both ex-tremes in these pages, with his characteristic straight talk and humor. He writes honestly of the lowest point in his career, the Keating Five savings and loan debacle, as well as his triumphant moments—his return to Vietnam and his efforts to normalize relations between the U.S. and Vietnamese governments; his fight for campaign finance reform; and his galvanizing bid for the presidency in 2000.Writes McCain: “A rebel without a cause is just a punk. Whatever you’re called—rebel, unorthodox, nonconformist, radical—it’s all self-indulgence without a good cause to give your life meaning.” This is the story of McCain’s causes, the people who made him do it, and the meaning he found.

When he looked at his own industry, however, he saw that the media far too often ignored their primary mission: to provide objective, disinterested reporting.

The liberal bias continued.Now, breaking ranks and naming names, he reveals a corporate news culture in which the closed-mindedness is breathtaking and in which entertainment wins over hard news every time.; Performing Arts , Business Aspects;Regnery Publishing, Inc.;4.99;February;2001

That was the beginning of her ""journey of the spirit.""Plain and Simple, illustrated with the author's own drawings, is the gentle, eloquent story of that journey. Bender, a wife, a mother, and a dedicated artist from Berkeley, California, sought out Amish families that would allow her-one of the outsiders the Amish call the ""English""-- to visit and share in their daily fives.In language as spare and vivid as Amish art, Bender recounts her venture into an entirely different world, the seemingly timeless world of the Amish, a landscape of immense inner quiet. With an inquiring eye, she describes the months she spent in Iowa and Ohio with two Amish families. She illuminates the everyday rhythms of their world and conveys the life of the people who taught her about simplicity, commitment, and the joy of doing what you do well.In nine chapters, as interrelated and well-crafted as a classic nine-patch Amish quilt, Bender speaks to the seeker in us all and reveals how she was drawn to -- and changed by -- the Amish values of austerity, humility, and the ordinary. ""How"" they live reflects what they believe"" she writes. ""Their life is their art!""After living and working with these people whose values were so unlike her own, Bender was able to return home and rework her ""crazy quilt"" life into a new pattern. ""I thought I was going to learn more about their quilts,"" she writes, ""but the quilts were only guides, leading me to what I really needed to learn, to answer a question I hadn't yet formed: ""Is there another way to lead a good life?"""; Religion , Christianity , Amish;HarperOne;5.29;October;1989

Tom Brown's Schooldays (Oxford World's Classics);By Sanders, Andrew, Hughes, Arthur, and Hughes, Thomas;One of the classics of English children's literature, and one of the earliest books written specifically for boys, this novel's steady popularity has given it an influence well beyond the upper middle-class world that it describes.

In Our Own Image: Building an Artificial Person;By Caudill, Maureen;"From Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator, to C-3PO of the Star Wars trilogy, to the comic robot-butler in Woody Allen's Sleeper, the ""android"" has long been a familiar figure on the American imaginative landscape. But how far removed from reality are such fictitious creations? Will there ever be an intelligent robot in our future? Neural networks expert Maureen Caudill says yes. In fact, she argues that the development of intelligent androids is a mere twenty years away.    In Our Own Image reveals just how far we've come in developing an intelligent robot, describes what technical obstacles must still be cleared, and--perhaps most interesting of all--outlines the potentially massive social disruptions and tangled moral and legal dilemmas these ""human machines"" will cause. In a sweeping look at state-of-the-art breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, robotics, computer science, psychology, and neural networks, Caudill shows how these fields have advanced machine vision, language recognition, problem solving, memory, and other requisites of intelligent robots. She describes foot-long mechanical ants that can follow you around a room, robots that can crack eggs, shear sheep, play ping-pong, tighten wing-nuts, and other feats of dexterity. (One robot, WABOT-2, developed in Japan, can read simple sheet music and played the electric organ with the NHK Symphony Orchestra of Japan.) electric organ.) And she concludes that as our ability to make faster, smaller, cheaper computers blends with our ability to mimic the behavior of the human mind, the first truly intelligent machines come closer to fruition. But once an android has been perfected, Caudill warns, there will likely be some unexpected--and perhaps unpleasant--social changes. Androids may compete with human workers for jobs--and robots won't take vacations, won't have family problems, and might never leave the firm. Androids may also entangle our legal system in complex, difficult questions: Can an individual own an intelligent android? What rights should it have in society? Does ownership of an android imply the right to turn it off--the right to ""kill"" it? And does such ownership brand us as slaveholders?    The existence of intelligent androids will provoke these and other questions. Caudill concludes that we will soon be forced to come up with answers if we are to learn to share the world with another intelligent species--one of our own creation.";;Oxford University Press;4.99;October;1992

Leaving Town Alive: Confessions of an Arts Warrior;By Frohnmayer, John;"Brimming with optimism, John Frohnmayer journeyed to Washington, D.C., in 1989 to serve a cause he believed in deeply: the arts in America. Appointed by President Bush to be chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, he was abruptly fired two and a half years later in a storm of front-page controversy.Leaving Town Alive is Frohnmayer's lively and startlingly candid account of his trial by fire in the brutal world of power politics. Taking over the NEA amid the uproar about Robert Mapplethorpe's sexually explicit photographs, Frohnmayer stood at the center of the emotional debate over public funding for the arts. On the left were staunch defenders of free speech and the artists whose confrontational works came under attack. On the right were Jesse Helms and the fundamentalist proponents of traditional values.At first Frohnmayer assumed that he could negotiate anything and that everyone had the best interests of the country at heart. He was wrong: the White House, for instance, just wanted the problem of ""offensive art"" to go away, while right-wing fund-raisers wanted to keep the issue alive as long as possible. In the end, Frohnmayer's harrowing education changed him. He entered the fray a First Amendment moderate; he emerged a free-speech radical.John Frohnmayer had an insider's view of Washington during the Bush years, and he writes with remarkable frankness about the bitter battles over the government's involvement in the arts. Passionate, witty, and wonderfully readable, Leaving Town Alive is, finally, an eloquent plea for the liberation of American culture from the narrow concerns of partisan politics."; Political Science , General;Houghton Mifflin Harcourt;4.99;April;1993

Silent Sons: A Book for and About Men;By Ackerman, Robert J.;It could be you or someone you love. Strong, silent types are everywhere, and it is their telltale silence that has kept their problems hidden until now. A silent son can come from a family that coped with violence, alcoholism, child abuse, extreme rigidity, or divorce, but all silent sons have certain common characteristics:   They keep things that bother them to themselves.  They deny that unpleasant events occur.  They fear letting people know them.  They have difficulty interacting with their parents, spouses, or children.  They have a strong fear of criticism.  They are often angry.   In Silent Sons, Dr. Robert Ackerman, a silent son himself, examines the problems that commonly confront silent sons, keeping them from experiencing the full range of human emotions. In a compassionate and hopeful voice, the author defines the silent son and examines the impact of parents, particularly fathers, on these men and shows how their dysfunctional upbringing affects their present relationships, especially with women.  By putting aside anger, finding peace with one's self, and looking for support from other silent sons, Dr. Ackerman feels every man can realize his full potential and become a well balanced, healthy survivor.; Psychology , General;Touchstone;4.99;October;1994

What Went Wrong?: Western Impact and Middle Eastern Response;By Lewis, Bernard;"For many centuries, the world of Islam was in the forefront of human achievement--the foremost military and economic power in the world, the leader in the arts and sciences of civilization. Christian Europe, a remote land beyond its northwestern frontier, was seen as an outer darkness of barbarism and unbelief from which there was nothing to learn or to fear. And then everything changed, as the previously despised West won victory after victory, first in the battlefield and the marketplace, then in almost every aspect of public and even private life.    In this intriguing volume, Bernard Lewis examines the anguished reaction of the Islamic world as it tried to understand why things had changed--how they had been overtaken, overshadowed, and to an increasing extent dominated by the West. Lewis provides a fascinating portrait of a culture in turmoil. He shows how the Middle East turned its attention to understanding European weaponry and military tactics, commerce and industry, government and diplomacy, education and culture. Lewis highlights the striking differences between the Western and Middle Eastern cultures from the 18th to the 20th centuries through thought-provoking comparisons of such things as Christianity and Islam, music and the arts, the position of women, secularism and the civil society, the clock and the calendar.   Hailed in The New York Times Book Review as ""the doyen of Middle Eastern studies,"" Bernard Lewis is one of the West's foremost authorities on Islamic history and culture. In this striking volume, he offers an incisive look at the historical relationship between the Middle East and Europe."; History , Middle East , General;Oxford University Press;8.79;December;2001

In so doing, she illuminates with great sensitivity and intelligence the elusive emotional wellsprings of the creative process.There is no ideal muse, but rather as many variations on the theme as there are individual women who have had the luck, or misfortune, to find their destiny conjoined with that of a particular artist. What are we to make of the relationship between the child Alice Liddell, who inspired Alice in Wonderland, and the Oxford don who became Lewis Carroll? Or the so-called serial muse, Lou Andreas-Salomé, who captivated Nietzsche, Rilke, and Freud—as impressive a list as any muse can boast? Salvador Dalí was the only artist to sign his art with his muse's name, and Gala Dalí certainly knew how to market her artist and his work while simultaneously burnishing her own image and celebrity.Lou, Gala, and Yoko Ono all defy the feminist stereotype of the muse as a passive beauty put on a pedestal and oppressed by a male artist. However, it's rare to find an artist and muse who are genuine partners, true collaborators, such as ballerina Suzanne Farrell and choreographer George Balanchine.What do the nine muses chosen by Francine Prose have in common? They were all beautiful, or sexy, or gifted with some more unconventional appeal. All loved, and were loved by, their artists, and inspired them with an intensity of emotion akin to Eros. For these artists, the love of—or for—their muses provided an essential element required for the melding of talent and technique necessary to create art.; Art , General;HarperCollins;4.99;September;2002

The American Style of Foreign Policy: Cultural Politics and Foreign Affairs;By Dallek, Robert;With American foreign policy playing an increasingly dominant role in world events of the past century, the international diplomatic community and even Americans themselves have staged heated debates centering on the charge that our government often misreads international crises.      Responding to the controversy, Robert Dallek's groundbreaking book argues that the pressures generated by unresolved political and social domestic problems have shaped American foreign policy. In an illuminating examination of each significant period--from the expansionism of the Spanish-American War and the American entrance into World War I, to American-Soviet relations during World War II, the Cold War period that followed, and American involvement in Korea and Vietnam--Dallek reveals why we have acted as we have, often in the face of logic and with costly consequences.       Providing a wealth of new insights, he presents American foreign policies in the twentieth century as symbolic extensions of domestic hopes and fears.  Reaching beyond traditional explanations of why and how these policies reflect U.S. concerns at home more than realities abroad, this important and provocative analysis challenges thinking Americans to confront the whole fascinating history of American foreign affairs in the twentieth century.; Political Science , International Relations , General;Oxford University Press;5.29;January;1990
D.H. Lawrence: The Story of a Marriage;By Maddox, Brenda;Maddox presents a richly detailed and startlingly new portrait of D. H. Lawrence: not the bearded prophet with the baleful eye, not the sickly and self-absorbed sexual outlaw, but a vulnerable, sensitive Lawrence, a hilarious mimic, a lover of nature, an inspired teacher, a brilliant journalist, an ecological visionary, and above all - as he saw himself - a married man.The prize-winning author of Nora (Mrs. James Joyce) examines Lawrence's perplexing, restless life through the greatest contradiction in it - his marriage to Frieda, a woman even more defiant of conventional morality than he was. Theirs was a mismatch made in heaven, a marriage with infidelities on both sides, verbal taunts and physical abuse, separations, and the strains of Lawrence's long struggle with tuberculosis. Yet her determined influence on his life and work cannot be overestimated, and they remained together until his bitter, tragic death.; Literary Criticism , European , English, Irish, Scottish, Welsh;Simon & Schuster;6.32;November;1994

Ashes of Glory: Richmond at War;By Furgurson, Ernest B.;"In Ashes of Glory, Ernest B. Furgurson conjures up wartime Richmond in vivid detail. We meet not only with such luminaries as Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis, and Stonewall Jackson but with a strikingly broad spectrum of the community: preachers, nurses, newspapermen, bureaucrats, entrepreneurs, slaves, slave dealers, bootleggers, actors, spies, prostitutes, prisoners of war, refugees, handsome widows, eager debutantes, and swarms of enlisted men and officers from all over the South.Furgurson ushers us into the legendary Spotswood Hotel, where generals and gentry communed amid gossip and bourbon. He admits us to the hospitals crammed with amputees and infested by rats. He plunges us into a bread riot involving several hundred citizens and spurred by a ""woman huckster."" He shows us that, despite universal hardship, Richmond fairly crackled with spirit: theater manager John Hill Hewitt kept melodrama flowing on the city's popular stages; taffy parties, faro parlors, and sewing circles kept various other constituencies entertained; Colonel Thomas E. Rose of Pennsylvania and dozens more tunneled out of notorious Libby Prison; the genteel Union sympathizer Elizabeth Van Lew conducted an elaborate and extraordinarily successful campaign of espionage. Meanwhile, beneath the surface, a compound of defiance, despair, and paranoia preyed on the nerves of everyone from President Davis on down, turning a stunned and battered, once-glamorous society virtually inside out.";History , United States , Civil War Period (1850-1877);Knopf;29.96;September;1996

With her earthy sensibility and sharp sense of humor, the author shows this world in a light devoid of preciousness—while expressing with heart the integrity of the spiritual work being undertaken. We come away from our visit to this exotic realm having found it both extraordinary and surprisingly familiar.

Unravelling;By Graver, Elizabeth;"From a small, bogside cabin in rural New England, 38-year-old Aimee Slater unravels the story of her life, attempting to make sense of the tangled thread that leads from her mother's house-a short, unbridgeable distance away-to the world she now inhabits. It is soon after the Civil War; Aimee lives alone, but is graced with visits from two friends, a crippled man and a troubled eleven-year-old girl. She is perpetually caught between the sensual world she so desires and the divine retribution passed down to her by her mother's scorn. How Aimee ultimately creates a life for herself and bridges that distance makes for a moving story of love and loss. Told in a voice of spare New England lyricism, Unravelling is a remarkably haunting account of the power of redemption."; Fiction , Historical;Houghton Mifflin;4.99;August;1999
An Obedient Father;By Sharma, Akhil;A stunning novel about family secrets, hailed nationwide as a masterpiece. Ram Karan, a corrupt official in the New Delhi school system, lives in one of the city's slums with his widowed daughter and his little granddaughter. Bumbling, sad, ironic, Ram is also a man corroded by a terrible secret. With the assassination of the politician Rajiv Gandhi, Ram is plunged into a series of escalating and possibly deadly political betrayals. As he tries to save his family, his daughter reveals a crime he had hoped was long buried-and Ram, struggling to survive, must make amends after a life of deception. Taking the reader deep into a world of Indian families and politics, gangsters and movie stars, riots and morgues, An Obedient Father is an astonishing fiction debut, a work of rare sensibilities that presents a character as tormented, funny, and morally ambiguous as one of Dostoyevsky's antiheroes.; Fiction , Sagas;Harvest Books;5.29;November;2001
Like the Red Panda;By Seigel, Andrea;"Stella Parrish is seventeen, attractive, smart, deeply alienated, and unable to countenance life's absurdities. She is not nihilistic; she is prematurely exhausted. Since her parents OD'd on designer drugs when she was eleven, she has lived with well-meaning but inexperienced foster parents, while her grandfather, her only living relative, tries ever more ingenious ways of committing suicide in his retirement home. Here are the last two weeks of Stella's senior year in Orange County, California: the intensive AP final exams; the childish, celebratory trips; the totemic importance attached to graduation. Beneath Stella's mordantly funny take on her life is the decisiveness with which she disengages from it, planting clues and providing explanations for those who will try to understand the act she is about to commit. With perfect pitch, remarkable wit, and a spare, vivid prose, Stella turns her farewell to suburbia into a wry philosophical inquiry."; Fiction , General;Harvest Books;4.99;April;2004

The Book of Intimate Grammar;By Grossman, David and Rosenberg, Betsy (TRN);David Grossman, the leading Israeli novelist of his generation, showed himself in his internationally acclaimed novel, See Under: LOVE, to be a consummate artist of the inner life of the child. Now, in his most moving and accessible novel yet, he gives us the story of the greatest and most universal tragedy, the loss of that childhood world. At twelve, Aron Kleinfeld is the ringleader among the boys in his Jerusalem neighborhood, their inspiration in dreaming up games and adventures. But as his friends begin to mature, Aron remains imprisoned for three long years in the body of a child. While Israel inches toward the Six-Day War, and while the voices of his friends change and become strange to him, Aron lives in his child body as though in a nightmare. Like a spy in enemy territory, he learns to decipher the internal codes of sexuality and desire, to understand the unyielding bureaucracy of the human body. Hurled between childhood and adulthood, between the pure and the profane, he is like a volcano of emotions and impulses. But, like his hero Houdini, Aron still struggles to escape from the trap of growing up.The Book of Intimate Grammar is about the alchemy of childhood, which transforms loneliness and fear into creation, and about the struggle to emerge as an artist. Funny, painful and passionate, it is a work of enormous intensity and beauty.; Fiction , Literary;Farrar Straus & Giroux;5.29;August;1994

Ritalin Nation: Rapid-Fire Culture and the Transformation of Human Consciousness;By Degrandpre, Richard J.;"By the year 2000, the USDA predicts that 15 percent-8 million-of our children will be on their way to using Ritalin. In this illuminating investigation of the epidemic of Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) today and its most widely prescribed treatment, the powerful psychostimulant Ritalin, psychologist Richard DeGrandpre sounds a warning: we may well be failing our children by treating symptoms and not causes with a quick-fix and ultimately unsatisfactory solution. Drawing on the latest findings from developmental, psychobiological, and social scientific research, DeGrandpre seeks to solve the problem of ADD by ""solving"" its history. He attributes the disturbing prevalence of inattention and hyperactivity in children to the larger societal consequences of a speed-up culture that has profoundly altered our perceptual expectations, our very experience of time, and our ability to defer gratification. Our society-wide rush to more, and faster, stimulation leaves children especially vulnerable to ""sensory addictions."" Ritalin Nation both exposes the shortsightedness of mere biological explanations of ADD and offers some practical guidelines for charting a more hopeful future in environments that deliberately ""make time for time,"" cultivate a less hurried existence, and promote a saner, safer community for our children."; Medical , Psychiatry , Child & Adolescent;W W Norton & Co Inc;5.29;January;1999
Ashes to Ashes: America's Hundred-Year Cigarette War, the Public Health, and the Unabashed Triumph of Philip Morris;By Kluger, Richard;"No book before this one has rendered the story of cigarettes -- mankind's most common self-destructive instrument and its most profitable consumer product -- with such sweep and enlivening detail.Here for the first time, in a story full of the complexities and contradictions of human nature, all the strands of the historical process -- financial, social, psychological, medical, political, and legal -- are woven together in a riveting narrative. The key characters are the top corporate executives, public health investigators, and antismoking activists who have clashed ever more stridently as Americans debate whether smoking should be closely regulated as a major health menace.We see tobacco spread rapidly from its aboriginal sources in the New World 500 years ago, as it becomes increasingly viewed by some as sinful and some as alluring, and by government as a windfall source of tax revenue. With the arrival of the cigarette in the late-nineteenth century, smoking changes from a luxury and occasional pastime to an everyday -- to some, indispensable -- habit, aided markedly by the exuberance of the tobacco huskers.This free-enterprise success saga grows shadowed, from the middle of this century, as science begins to understand the cigarette's toxicity. Ironically the more detailed and persuasive the findings by medical investigators, the more cigarette makers prosper by seeming to modify their product with filters and reduced dosages of tar and nicotine.We see the tobacco manufacturers come under intensifying assault as a rogue industry for knowingly and callously plying their hazardous wares while insisting that the health charges against them (a) remain unproven, and (b) are universally understood, so smokers indulge at their own risk.Among the eye-opening disclosures here: outrageous pseudo-scientific claims made for cigarettes throughout the '30s and '40s, and the story of how the tobacco industry and the National Cancer Institute spent millions to develop a ""safer"" cigarette that was never brought to market.Dealing with an emotional subject that has generated more heat than light, this book is a dispassionate tour de force that examines the nature of the companies' culpability, the complicity of society as a whole, and the shaky moral ground claimed by smokers who are now demanding recompense."; Business & Economics , General;Knopf;10.99;April;1996

Deadlock: The Inside Story of America's Closest Election;By Nakashima, Ellen;"When Americans cast their ballots on November 7, 2000, no one expected that the outcome of the presidential election would still be in doubt more than a month later. For the first time ever, the race for America's highest office had ended in a dead heat, with but a few hundred votes in Florida separating Vice President Al Gore and Governor George W.

The stage was set for an extraordinary drama of recounts, challenges, court cases - and hanging, swinging, and dimpled chads.Deadlock is the first comprehensive account of what really happened in the ""post-election"" of 2000, written and reported by the award-winning political staff of The Washington Post, America's premier newspaper for politics and elections.

Truman;By McCullough, David;The Pulitzer Prize–winning biography of Harry S. Truman, whose presidency included momentous events from the atomic bombing of Japan to the outbreak of the Cold War and the Korean War, told by America’s beloved and distinguished historian.The life of Harry S. Truman is one of the greatest of American stories, filled with vivid characters—Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, Eleanor Roosevelt, Bess Wallace Truman, George Marshall, Joe McCarthy, and Dean Acheson—and dramatic events. In this riveting biography, acclaimed historian David McCullough not only captures the man—a more complex, informed, and determined man than ever before imagined—but also the turbulent times in which he rose, boldly, to meet unprecedented challenges. The last president to serve as a living link between the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries, Truman’s story spans the raw world of the Missouri frontier, World War I, the powerful Pendergast machine of Kansas City, the legendary Whistle-Stop Campaign of 1948, and the decisions to drop the atomic bomb, confront Stalin at Potsdam, send troops to Korea, and fire General MacArthur. Drawing on newly discovered archival material and extensive interviews with Truman’s own family, friends, and Washington colleagues, McCullough tells the deeply moving story of the seemingly ordinary “man from Missouri” who was perhaps the most courageous president in our history.; Biography & Autobiography , Presidents & Heads of State;Simon & Schuster;6.87;June;1992

Alistair Cooke's America;By Cooke, Alistair;"Classics stand the test of time, and Alistair Cooke’s history of America is a classic. Nearly three decades have passed since the original edition of America?based on journalist-historian Cooke’s extraordinarily popular thirteen-part television series?sold more than a million copies. Yet Cooke’s view of America’s dynamic past and its impact upon the always-changing present continues to provide striking insights into the singular character of a nation. Those thirty years since award-winning America first rose to the top of best-seller lists have themselves wrought further dramatic changes. Presidents have been impeached, economies have toppled, empires have collapsed, and towers have fallen. In light of such events, Cooke has written for this new edition a compelling introduction and final chapter that bring his story of America up to date with the wisdom of the inimitably grand old man of correspondents. And what a story this book tells. From the discovery of America by European explorers to modern times; from the fighters for independence to the pioneers who tamed the West; from the slaves who fled to freedom to the huddled masses that sought a new life in the New World. And through it all, Cooke describes the essential forces that make America work so vitally. Updated in light of the September 11th tragedy, this new edition is complimented with full-color illustrations throughout. ?The first and maybe the finest, tribute to the nation.”?Newsweek ?A panoramic book, traveling fast and high, and the view it gives of our land and its people is exhilarating.”?Atlantic Monthly"; History , United States , General;Carroll & Graf;7.06;September;2002

Improvised Europeans: American Literary Expatriates In London;By Zwerdling, Alex;"At the turn of the century the United States seemed poised to overtake its European rivals on all fronts; its many strengths were finally being recognized—the wealth of resources, the profusion of ideas and innovation, and the artistic talent of its citizens. American power was expanding and American writers—including Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne, and Whitman—were acclaimed at home and abroad. England’s condescending air toward America had already become inappropriate. The United States had reached a new level of respectability in the world. In light of this favorable international climate, why then did some of America’s most talented young writers travel to London to become, as Henry Adams put it, ”improvised Europeans”?Few writers have been studied and analyzed as much as the quartet at the heart of this book. But Alex Zwerdling was perplexed by this shared and often overlooked aspect of their background: Why, at the dawn of the American century, did these writers choose to go ”back” to what was called ”the Old World”? And why would these brilliant thinkers include in some of their most acclaimed work material that is today reviled as offensive—anti-Semetic, racist, anti-feminist? What was happening in the United States that repelled them? In striving to answer these questions, Alex Zwerdling illuminates the lives and careers of Henry Adams, Henry James, T.S. Eliot, and Ezra Pound as never before.These men chose to live their lives abroad at a crucial point in American history, both domestically and internationally. The massive influx of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe began to whittle away the Anglo-Saxon majority. The end of slavery created a renewal of efforts to make true the Constitution’s claim to universal equality. Women’s confidence and authority grew as they fought for independence and their own rights. These developments, Zwerdling argues, were large factors in why these four writers fled. He examines their works and their lives in the context of the American scene they left, and also in the context of the British scene they left for. His brilliant cultural history uses personal correspondence, unprinted articles, and other previously unknown sources to unravel the historical forces that shaped these literary lions. Depicting their careers as a roller-coaster ride through alien territory, the book shows that they produced extraordinary work in the midst of perpetual friction, indifferece, and even active hostility."; Literary Criticism , American , General;Basic Books;5.7;May;1998

Voice Lessons: On Becoming a (Woman) Writer;By Mairs, Nancy;"Voice Lessons is a book about writing from a woman with a remarkable story to tell and an utterly distinctive voice in which to tell it. Nancy Mairs's essays have been called ""triumphs... of will, style, candor, thought and even form"" (Los Angeles Times). She has won acclaim for her autobiographical writing on themes from living with depression to renewing a marriage, from sex to religion. In Voice Lessons, Mairs's subjects are literary, but as always her approach is personal, revealing, and inspiring. Mairs first shares her sharply drawn story on how ""finding a voice"" as an essayist transformed her life when she was a graduate student, wife, and mother in her late thirties. In a tribute to the liberating power of literature and feminist ideas, she shows how the words of other writers made possible a new career, a new life in difficult times. Voice Lessons goes on to explore other women's writing and to outline a singular kind of literary life. Always grounding her writing in personal experience, always making ideas concrete, Mairs gives us essays on writing and the body, the challenges of autobiography, the revelatory power of Virginia Woolf and Alice Walker, the literature of personal disaster, and the art of dealing with rejection. Articulate, witty, incisive, and inspirational, Voice Lessons is a book for writers and aspiring writers, and for everyone who loves women's writing."; Literary Criticism , General;Beacon Press;5.29;January;1997

The Rich Are Different: A Priceless Treasury of Quotations and Anecdotes About the Affluent, the Posh, a nd the Just Plain Loaded;By Winokur, Jon (EDT);"""The very rich are different from you and me,"" said F. Scott Fitzgerald.  How different?  Well, Ivana Trump so abhors footprints on the carpet that she has the rooms in her home freshly vacuumed before she enters them.  Christina Onassis used to have Diet Coke flown to her by private jet.  And the elite members of San Francisco's Union Pacific Club needn't worry about handling dirty money, since every coin the enters the institution is scoured by the kitchen staff.These are just a few of the hilariously outrageous facts and anecdotes that Jon Winokur has assembled in this eye-popping field guide to the habits of the equestrian class.  From the schlock of the Nouveau to the stinginess of Old Money, here are the follies and foibles of such plutocrats as William Vanderbilt and Leona Helmsley, Aristotle Onassis and Doris Duke.  You'll learn how the super-rich get, conserve and squander their fortunes; how they thwart tax collectors, buy legislative bodies (not to mention entire countries), and literally get away with murder.  Here are a few of the most delicious: * The Sultan of Brunei flew the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to London for his son's ninth birthday party at a cost of $1 million.* Asked why she was carried everywhere by a burly attendant, Barbara Hutton replied, ""Why should I walk when I can hire someone to do it for me?""* When the late Time Warner boss Steve Ross flew his wife and two other couples to Mexico one Christmas, the trip required two corporate planes: One for people and one for gifts.* Donald Trump's 727 had 24-karat-gold seat-belt buckles.* The teenage Doris Duke's limousine was equipped with a panic button she could push whenever a boy tried to kiss her."; Humor , Form , Parodies;Pantheon;5.29;October;1996

Nine Innings;By Okrent, Daniel;You'll never watch baseball the same way again. A timeless baseball classic and a must read for any fan worthy of the name, Nine Innings dissects a single baseball game played in June 1982 -- inning by inning, play by play. Daniel Okrent, a seasoned writer and lifelong fan, chose as his subject a Milwaukee Brewers<endash>Baltimore Orioles matchup, though it could have been any game, because, as Okrent reveals, the essence of baseball, no matter where or when it's played, has been and will always be the same. In this particular moment of baseball history you will discover myriad aspects of the sport that are crucial to its nature but so often invisible to the fans -- the hidden language of catchers' signals, the physiology of pitching, the balance sheet of a club owner, the gait of a player stepping up to the plate. With the purity of heart and unwavering attention to detail that characterize our national pastime, Okrent goes straight to the core of the world's greatest game.

Call To Home: African Americans Reclaim The Rural South;By Stack, Carol B.;"Many books have told the epic story of the black migration from the South, a migration that by the 1970s had all but stopped. Instead, one by one African Americans began returning to some of the least promising places, places the Department of Agriculture calls ""persistent poverty counties."" In Call to Home, Carol Stack tells us why.Here are the stories of people trading their apartments in the city for trailers, old cabins, or brick houses built along dusty Southern back roads. Some were pushed rather than drawn back by rootlessness, joblessness, and urban decay. Others, made stronger by the uncompromising demands of city life, came home determined to apply the hard lessons they'd learned up north to build new lives in the South. Still others returned to recover what they had lost. Children often were sent home first, either to be cared for or to help care for grandparents who never left.Call to Home is the story of hardships - of starting over, of poverty, of rural life - but is also the story of success, of how people determined to build real communities and to set things right helped to establish the right of black Americans to participate as full citizens in the American South."; Social Science , Ethnic Studies , African American Studies;Basic Books;5.29;April;1996

Taking on the World: Joseph and Stewart Alsop, Guardians of the American Century;By Merry, Robert W.;"In 1948 the column-writing Alsop brothers produced an article for the Saturday Evening Post, then the country's preeminent weekly magazine. Its title: ""Must America Save the World?"" Their answer was a resounding yes. Indeed, Joseph and Stewart Alsop were there in those heady postwar years when the country's foreign-policy elite created what became known as the American Century. As men of words, they served as confidants of and cheerleaders for the men of deeds, who came largely from the country's patrician class.The Alsop brothers were themselves sons of this class. Theodore Roosevelt was the brothers' great-uncle. Eleanor Roosevelt was their mother's first cousin. They grew up with members of this Anglo-Saxon elite, went to school with them, socialized with them. And they threw the considerable weight of their column behind the efforts of these statesmen to refashion the world. Writing four times a week, they appeared in nearly two hundred newspapers; their work also graced the pages of the major magazines of the time. Thus, they wielded immense influence throughout the nation from the victory in World War II to the defeat in Vietnam.Stewart was a political analyst of rare acumen, while Joe, his older brother, was a curmudgeon with an aristocratic bearing and a biting wit. He once likened a dinner at Lyndon Johnson's to ""going to an opera in which one man sings all the parts."" He was a friend and confidant of John Kennedy, a teacher of Washington ways to Jackie Kennedy. When he called people in the highest echelons of officialdom, they responded.In Taking On the World, Robert W. Merry, a Washington insider himself, has fashioned an intricate and fascinating combination of biography and narrative history. As Mr. Merry puts it, ""Within the lifetime of the Alsop brothers the country was remade. And its remaking illuminates their careers, just as their careers illuminate the American Century."" Robert Merry casts brilliant light on these two remarkable men, and on one of the most tumultuous periods of the country's history."; Biography & Autobiography , General;Viking Adult;4.99;February;1996
Born to Rebel: Birth Order, Family Dynamics, and Creative Lives;By Sulloway, Frank J.;"Why are individuals from the same family often no more similar in personality than those from different families? Why, within the same family, do some children conform to authority whereas others rebel? The family, it turns out, is not a ""shared environment"" but rather a set of niches that provide siblings with different outlooks.At the heart of this pioneering inquiry into human development is a fundamental insight: that the personalities of siblings vary because they adopt different strategies in the universal quest for parental favor. Frank J. Sulloway's most important finding is that eldest children identify with parents and authority, and support the status quo, whereas younger children rebel against it. Drawing on the work of Darwin and the new sciences of evolutionary psychology, he transforms our understanding of personality development and its origins in family dynamics.Most persuasively, Sulloway's findings offer conclusive evidence that the family, with its powerful interpersonal dynamics, is a cauldron for the great revolutionary advances that drive historical change. Through his analysis of revolutions in social and scientific thought, from the Reformation to Darwin's theory of natural selection, Sulloway demonstrates that the primary engine of history is located within families, not between them, as Marx believed.This landmark work illuminates the crucial influence that family niches have on personality, and documents the profound consequences of sibling competition - not only on individual development within the family, but on society as a whole. Born to Rebel's pathbreaking insights promise to revolutionize the nature of psychological, sociological, and historical inquiry."; Psychology , Applied Psychology;Pantheon;8.79;October;1996
The Monitor Chronicles : One Sailor's Account : Today's Campaign to Recover the Civil War Wreck;By Mariners' Museum (Newport News, Va.) (COR), Geer, George S. (EDT), and Marvel, William (EDT);"Marking the ongoing efforts to recover the 136-year-old wreck of the USS Monitor, The Mariners' Museum presents a lavishly illustrated commemorative volume of the renowned Civil War ironclad's past and present.  The short, fabled life of the USS Monitor began on January 30, 1862, at Green Point, Brooklyn, New York, and ended on December 31 of that same year, when the legendary Civil War ironclad sank in 230 feet of water off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Serving on the Monitor -- where engines and living space lay completely below the waterline and the iron deck rose a scant eighteen inches above it -- was like no other duty in the U.S. Navy. The Monitor Chronicles brings shipboard experience to life through the words of Civil War sailor George S. Geer, whose never-before-published letters home to his beloved wife, Martha, faithfully chronicle the events of that dramatic year. Like many men of his station, George Geer had joined Abraham Lincoln's navy less to help save the Union than to earn money and learn a reliable trade, so his accounts are unflinchingly honest -- at times colored by the bravado of a man at war, at others tinged with the pathos of a man in danger and far from home. When, on the morning of March 9, 1862, the Monitor and the CSS Virginia fought the first battle between ironclad warships, Geer recalled,""I often thought of you and the little darlings when the fight was going on and what should become of you should I be killed....But I should have no more such fears as our ship resisted everything they could fire at her as though they were spit balls."" Whether he sweated in the searing heat or simply waited while the Monitor danced a strategic minuet with the enemy, his words confirm and amplify the proud legacy of the vessel whose very existence brought an end to the era of wooden warships. On January 2, 1863, Geer reported, ""I am sorry to have to write you that we have lost the Monitor."" He survived, but sixteen men were lost in a raging sea that seemed to have claimed the ship for eternity. But the story told in The Monitor Chronicles doesn't end there. The book captures a piece of living history, as men and machines attempt to recover the wreck even as it begins to succumb to the elements after 136 years on the ocean floor. Because The Mariners' Museum serves as the official repository of the USS Monitor National Marine Sanctuary, readers will be treated to spectacular underwater views of the Monitor, as well as to an unprecedented look at the salvage efforts. Although more than a century has passed since the ship itself sailed into history, The Monitor Chronicles provides not only a fresh, uniquely intimate view of the Monitor's fateful year as the world's first iron warship but also a provocative glimpse of"; History , Military , Naval;Simon & Schuster;19.7;July;2000
Fire in My Soul;By Lester, Joan Steinau and Norton, Eleanor Holmes;"Here is the remarkable story of U.S. Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton -- impassioned civil rights activist, hard-driving legislator, and one of the most powerful women in American history.  They call her the ""Warrior on the Hill,"" acknowledging the battles she's waged as a political pioneer across more than four decades of American history. Perhaps more than anyone else, she has taken to heart Eleanor Roosevelt's famous pronouncement that ""every political woman needs to develop skin as tough as rhinoceros hide.""  Joan Steinau Lester shared much of the last forty years with Eleanor Holmes Norton. They met in 1958 when they were both students at Antioch College. Now an acclaimed author, Lester shares her friendship with the congresswoman and tells the story of one woman's rise to leadership. Charting forty years of political and personal challenge, Fire in My Soul shows Norton marching on the Capitol to demand a Senate hearing for Anita Hill; grilling Army generals about sex abuse; arguing before the Supreme Court to uphold first amendment rights, even for a segregationist; and much more. Norton's story is organically linked to Washington, D.C., home to her family for four generations, and reveals why she is now the voice of the city.  This fascinating biography, told largely in Norton's words, showcases as never before the many facets of a woman who remains an iconic torch-bearer for the legacy of the Civil Rights Movement. Scores of conversations with Norton and nearly a hundred interviews with colleagues, family, and friends have made Fire in My Soul a remarkable document of how one extraordinary woman helped to effect lasting change in the ways we interact across racial and gender lines."; Biography & Autobiography , Political;Atria;5.53;January;2003

Hollywood vs. America: The Explosive Bestseller that Shows How-and Why-the Entertainment Industry Has Broken Faith With Its Audience;By Medved, Michael;"Why does our popular culture seem so consistently hostile to the values that most Americans hold dear? Why does the entertainment industry attack religion, glorify brutality, undermine the family, and deride patriotism? In this explosive book, one of the nation's best known film critics examines how Hollywood has broken faith with its public, creating movies, television, and popular music that exacerbate every serious social problem we face, from teenage pregnancies to violence in the streets. Michael Medved powerfully argues that the entertainment business follows its own dark obsessions, rather than giving the public what it wants: In fact, the audience for feature films and network television has demonstrated its profound disillusionment in recent years, with disastrous consequences for many entertainment companies.  Meanwhile, overwhelming numbers of our fellow citizens complain about the wretched quality of our popular culture--describing the offerings of the mass media as the worst ever.  Medved asserts that Hollywood ignores--and assaults--the values of ordinary American families, pursuing a self-destructive and alienated ideological agenda that is harmful to the nation at large and to the industry's own interests. In hard-hitting chapters on ""The Attack on Religion,"" ""The Addiction to Violence,"" ""Promoting Promiscuity,"" ""The Infatuation with Foul Language,"" ""Kids Know Best,"" ""Motivations for Madness,"" and other subjects, Medved outlines the underlying themes that turn up again and again in our popular culture.  He also offers conclusive evidence of the frightening real-world impact of these messages on our society and our children. Finally, Medved shows where and how Hollywood took a disastrous wrong turn toward its current crisis, and he outlines promising efforts both in and outside the industry to restore a measure of sanity and restraint to our media of mass entertainment.Sure to elicit strong response, whether it takes the form of cheers of support or howls of enraged dissent, Hollywood vs. America confronts head-on one of the most significant issues of our times."; Social Science , Popular Culture;Harper Perennial;5.29;August;1993

Hundt, chairman from 1993 to 1997 of the Federal Communications Commission, the nation’s chief regulatory agency for media and communications industries, tells of the battles for political advantage that lie behind the enormous creation of wealth and social changes that are generally called the “New Economy.” The central theme of the narrative is the surprising passage and fascinating implementation of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which authorized the Federal Communications Commission to replace monopoly with competition and to guarantee access to the Internet to all Americans, including every child in every classroom.Depending on the leadership of his high school classmate Al Gore and finding unexpected allies in the ranks of free market ideologues, Hundt led the FCC to make the decisions that helped start a wave of entrepreneurship, which in turn has given the United States the world’s leading Internet economy. As the memoir shows, every decision involved prodigious political battles—between existing industries and start-ups, between Newt Gingrich and the Clinton-Gore White House, between inside-the-Beltway lobbyists and the new grassroots advocacy of e-mails, between the politics of money and the politics of ideas. In the same period, the often ignored and historically maligned FCC was the place where government decided whether to undertake the largest national initiative to reform K–12 education in the country’s history: the program to connect every classroom to the Internet by the year 2001.Hundt’s report from the political battlefield offers significant insight into the motives and personality not only of Al Gore but other prominent figures in political life, as well as many of the media moguls of our time. Told with great energy and wit, it is a tale that inspires both concern for and confidence in our democracy in the information age.; Political Science , Public Affairs & Administration;Yale University Press;5.0;March;2000

Intelligent Business Alliances: How to Profit Using Today's Most Important Strategic Tool;By Segil, Larraine;Alliances between companies have become a crucial weapon in the battle for competitive advantage. Managed wisely, a strategic alliance can help companies develop and exploit their unique strengths. For example, a large company can break down the marketing barriers that face a small company, which in turn brings entrepreneurial creativity to the partnership. An alliance can also be a powerful tool for accessing new technology and developing domestic or international business opportunities.Yet many companies mismanage their alliances, leading to wasted money, time, and effort, sometimes with disastrous results. In Intelligent Business Alliances, consultant Larraine Segil shows how to establish and manage winning alliances, starting with the crucial process of picking the right partner and creating realistic expectations on both sides. Segil then explains how to analyze the corporate and individual personality types involved in an alliance, using her unique Mindshift approach, which can help managers forecast and avoid problems due to miscommunication or mismatched value systems.Based on the author's years of experience as an entrepreneur, attorney, and international consultant specializing in alliance strategies, Intelligent Business Alliances covers every important type of alliance, including partnerships, joint ventures, distribution deals, and equity investments. It offers practical advice on every stage of the alliance process, from exploratory talks through negotiating the deal and day-to-day management of the alliance.; Business & Economics , Development , Business Development;Crown Business;5.29;August;1996

For people all over the world, Anne Frank, the vivacious, intelligent Jewish girl with a crooked smile and huge dark eyes, has become the ""human face of the Holocaust."" Her diary of twenty-five months in hiding, a precious record of her struggle to keep hope alive through the darkest days of this century, has touched the hearts of millions.

Full of revelations, this richly textured biography casts new light on Anne's relations with her mother, whom she treats harshly in the diary, and solves an enduring mystery: who betrayed the families hiding in the annex just when liberation was at hand?

St. John's Wort;By Rosenthal, Norman;"It's a simple yellow wildflower whose extraordinary properties have been documented for centuries.  Hypericum, or St. John's wort, as it is more commonly known, has emerged in Germany as one of the most popular, effective, and safe treatments for a devastating disease that affects millions:  depression. Now, for the first time, the worlds of conventional medicine and alternative healing have at last come together to embrace St. John's wort's exceptional powers.

Long Road to Freedom: The Advocate History of the Gay and Lesbian Movement (Stonewall Inn Editions);By Thompson, Mark (EDT);The emergence of the gay and lesbian community in the last quarter century has confronted America with what has become the new civil rights movement of the nineties, as millions of gay people assert their right to live as decent American citizens without the fear of persecution and discrimination.Since 1967 - two years before the Stonewall Riots, usually seen as the beginning of gay liberation - The Advocate has been the nations publication of record for the gay community. From its humble beginnings as a newsletter covering Southern California's homosexual subculture to its prominence today as a newsmagazine read around the world, The Advocate has mirrored the astonishing growth of the community it's served.Now the remarkable history of the modern gay and lesbian movement - a quarter century of rebellion and reform, tragedy and triumph - fills the hundreds of pages of news, photographs, essays, cartoons, and interviews culled from The Advocate. From first-person accounts of the Stonewall Riots to the tragic last day of Harvey Milk's life, from the crisis of AIDS to the controversy over outing, the milestones of the movement are presented as they happened, along with accounts of the lighter side of gay life, from disco divas to the politics of drag.Each year is introduced by a distinguished gay or lesbian historian or movement leader. Martin Duberman, Lillian Faderman, Allan Berube, Felice Picano, Urvashi Vaid, Joan Nestle, John Preston, Torie Osborn, and Randy Shilts are among those interpreting this revolutionary movement that has affected millions of people across the world.; Social Science , General;St Martins Pr;7.03;May;1994

Songs from the Hills: An Intimate Look at Country Music;By Von Matthiessen, Maria;"Country music has a rich history with roots that reach into the land - the Tennessee hills - and a future that stretches across the continents. It both touches and calls forth what is most essential about common human experience. But until now, the images we have seen from it have traditionally been glitzy, posed, star shots. This book presents a different kind of vision, a vision, that, through photography, puts us in touch with all the emotions chronicled in the music. Here are revealing photos of Roy Acuff, Eddy Arnold, Chet Atkins, Kitty Wells, June Carter Cash, Loretta Lynn, Ronnie Milsap, Charlie Daniels, Waylon Jennings, Emmylou Harris, Tanya Tucker, Rosanne Cash, Billy Ray Cyrus, Brooks & Dunn, Vince Gill, Lorrie Morgan, Trisha Yearwood, Kathy Mattea - and scores more of the artists who define country past, present, and future.Maria von Matthiessen is a photographer of unique vision, style, and technique. Her portraits of these artists cut beneath showmanship and ""image"" to capture what is essential. Startling, charming, beautiful, often whimsical, and always revealing - together the photos present an intimate look at the world of country musicians and reveal its rarely glimpsed core."; Music , Genres & Styles , Country & Bluegrass;Macmillan Pub Co;10.99;October;1993

The Mammoth Cheese: A Novel;By Holman, Sheri;"The world has come to Three Chimneys, Virginia. This tiny, rural town is home to Manda and Jake Frank, who overnight have become international celebrities as the parents of eleven tiny infants, born through fertility treatments. Their pastor and spokesperson, the Reverend Leland Vaughn, tries to shield them from the media frenzy, but even his head is turned when presidential hopeful Adams Brooke pays the family a visit.But there is one woman in town for whom Brooke's visit means so much more. Artisanal cheesemaker Margaret Prickett is struggling to save her centuries-old family farm. Suffering through a messy divorce and trying to raise her rebellious thirteen-year-old daughter, Polly, Margaret pins her farm's salvation on the sweeping amnesty Brooke promises America's independent farmers. With the help of her farmhand (and Thomas Jefferson impersonator) August Vaughn, Margaret works single-mindedly to get Brooke elected. In his honor, the two decide to re-create the Mammoth Cheese, a 1,235 pound wheel of Cheshire made by Thomas Jefferson's supporters and transported to Washington in 1801. As winter progresses, and the town's excitement over the ""Frank Eleven"" begins to wither, Three Chimneys turns its attention to Margaret's hopeful gift. But as the cheese makes its way to the nation's capital, and Polly slips deeper into a dangerous relationship with her radical history teacher, Margaret soon finds that trying to preserve what she has may very well cost her all she holds dear."; Fiction , Historical;Atlantic Monthly Pr;4.99;July;2003

Guilty: The Collapse of Criminal Justice;By Rothwax, Harold J.;Rothwax takes us inside his courtroom and tells tales of justice gone awry that only a seasoned judge could disclose. We are in his chambers as he does battle with lawyers more interested in their personal ambitions than justice. We are at a judicial conference where Rothwax stumps fifty appeals court judges, who admit they don't understand the Supreme Court's latest search-and-seizure rulings. We are in the courtroom, where Rothwax must sit patiently and allow lawyers to willfully obfuscate the truth.According to Rothwax, America is fast becoming a nation of bad laws, in which criminals and defense attorneys hide behind a morass of poorly conceived statutes, procedures, and rulings that prevent courts from resolving the paramount question at hand: Did the accused commit the crime? In trial after maddening trial, Rothwax sees the truth sacrificed at the altar of an increasingly areane process designed to protect the rights of criminals.; Law , Criminal Law , General;Random House;4.99;January;1996

Big Trouble: A Murder in a Small Western Town Sets Off a Struggle for the Soul of America;By Lukas, J. Anthony;"From the author of Common Ground -- one of the most acclaimed books of recent years -- comes a grand narrative of the United States as it charged, full of hope and trepidation, into the twentieth century.J. Anthony Lukas, a masterful storyteller, tells a mesmerizing tale -- of a terrible murder, a great trial, and the struggle they set off for the soul of America.Big Trouble begins on a snowy evening at Christmas time 1905 in the little town of Caldwell, Idaho, to which the state's former governor, Frank Steunenberg, had returned to head his family bank while contemplating his political future. As he walked home that night, he sensed all about him the bold, exuberant, unashamedly acquisitive spirit of Caldwell's young entrepreneurs, who -- as his brother had written -- were ""here for the money."" Like so many in the West at that time, these brothers believed their prospects for enriching themselves were limitless, that the future opened wide before them.ANd yet the governor suffered premonitions that he and his neighbors weren't fully in control of their own destiny, that something malign threatened their well-being.Now, as he followed the plume of his frozen breath, his boots crunching eight inches of freshly frozen snow, he turned through his garden gate and a bomb attached to the gatepost blew him ""into eternity.""";History , United States , 20th Century;Simon & Schuster;8.79;October;1997

Branch Rickey's Little Blue Book: Wit and Strategy from Baseball's Last Wise Man;By Monteleone, John J. and Rickey, Branch;Branch Rickey was a man of many words and many accomplishments. One of the architects of modern baseball, he built the farm club system of producing major league players and pioneered the application of technology (e.g., the batting machine) in instruction. Rickey's finest moment came in 1947 when he brought up Jackie Robinson to play for the Brooklyn Dodgers, thereby breaking the color barrier in major league baseball.In Branch Rickey's Little Blue Book, Rickey (primarily in his own words and in the words of those who knew him) shares his secrets for success both on and off the diamond. Culled from Rickey's writings, letters, scouting reports, and lectures, this collection reveals Rickey's peerless understanding of the game, his motivational techniques, and his respect for the rules and people that drive our national pastime.; Sports & Recreation , Baseball , History;Macmillan General Reference;5.29;June;1995

What Just Happened: A Chronicle from the Information Frontier;By Gleick, James;Here’s some of what just happened: Millions of ordinary, sensible people came into possession of computers. These machines had wondrous powers, yet made unexpected demands on their owners. Telephones broke free of the chains that had shackled them to bedside tables and office desks. No one was out of touch, or wanted to be out of touch. Instant communication became a birthright.A new world, located no one knew exactly where, came into being, called “virtual” or “online,” named “cyberspace” or “the Internet” or just “the network.” Manners and markets took on new shapes and guises.As all this was happening, James Gleick, author of the groundbreaking Chaos, columnist for The New York Times Magazine, and—very briefly—an Internet entrepreneur, emerged as one of our most astute guides to this new world. His dispatches—by turns passionate, bewildered, angry, and amazed—form an extraordinary chronicle. Gleick loves what the network makes possible, and he hates it. Software makers developed a strangely tolerant view of an ancient devil, the product defect. One company, at first a feisty upstart, seized control of the hidden gears and levers of the new economy. We wrestled with novel issues of privacy, anonymity, and disguise. We found that if the human species is evolving a sort of global brain, it’s susceptible to new forms of hysteria and multiple-personality disorder.What Just Happened is at once a remarkable portrait of a world in the throes of transformation and a prescient guide to the transformation still to come.; Computers , General;Pantheon;5.29;May;2002

Bubbles Ablaze;By Strohmeyer, Sarah;"The irrepressible heroine of Sarah Strohmeyer's Agatha Award-winning series makes her usual headline-grabbing entrance just in time to heat up Pennsylvania's coal country-in another rip-roaring tale of murder and mayhem.  Bubbles Ablaze finds the redoubtable Ms. Bubbles Yablonsky heeding a call from her boss at the News-Times and racing her Camaro toward a potentially big news story. But when she arrives at an abandoned coal mine, she finds the love of her life, Steve Stiletto, knocked unconscious . . . and the body of another man with a sizeable hole in his chest. Moments later, Bubbles and Stiletto are trapped by an explosion. Convinced that someone wants them dead, they search for their intended assassin in coal country, where they uncover a conspiracy at the Main Mane hairdressing salon, a cadre of women known as the Sirens of Slagville, and a hot spot called Limbo that's been burning underground for forty years.  With a cast of characters headed by the usual suspects-Bubbles's brainy teenage daughter Jane; Jane's clueless boyfriend G; and that dynamite duo, her mother LuLu and paranoid sidekick Genevieve- and led by the singular Bubbles herself, this is another fast and furious tale that will keep readers in Limbo-and in stitches."; Fiction , Mystery & Detective , Women Sleuths;Dutton Adult;8.79;June;2003
The Third Sister: A Continuation of Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility;By Barrett, Julia;"In Sense and Sensibility Jane Austen, that so long mistaken avatar of Victorian propriety while actually its wittiest and subtlest critic, wrote of Margaret Dashwood, the third sister: ""Margaret, the other sister, was a good-humored, well-disposed girl; but as she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne's romance, without having much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life.""At the same time that she so faithfully, with love and respect, evokes Jane Austen's style and characters and ambience, Julia Barrett bids fair to show Margaret's creator happily wrong in her estimation of Margaret's at first vulnerable, then shrewd and winning potential, the exercise of which makes for the substance of this remarkable novel on its own.But of course, Jane Austen couldn't know of Margaret's metamorphosis. Or perhaps she did, and meant one day to say so herself. Whatever, The Third Sister is an imaginative, creative continuation of Sense and Sensibility, featuring a Margaret Dashwood, the third sister, once so underestimated, who turns out to fool even her creator."; Fiction , General;Dutton Adult;4.99;August;1996

Death Benefit: A Lawyer Uncovers a 20-year Pattern of Seduction, Arson and Murder;By Heilbroner, David and Keeney, Steven;"For Steve Keeney, it began with a simple favor. A woman from Keeney's Louisville church, Bobbie Roberts, confided that her twenty-year-old daughter Deana had recently died in a cliff fall at Big Sur, California. Bobbie was now having trouble collecting burial insurance. Keeney, a successful corporate lawyer, agreed to help her cut through the red tape.The coroner's report stated that a couple named B.J. and Virginia McGinnis had driven Deana to a four-hundred-foot Big Sur cliff. The McGinnises said that when their backs had been turned, the girl had fallen ""without a sound."" Days after reading this report, Keeney was stunned to learn that Virginia had paid for a life insurance policy on Deana one day before the accident.Keeney suspected foul play, but Big Sur authorities quietly dropped the case: There were no witnesses other than the McGinnises. Undeterred, Keeney promised his client that he would try to find out the truth. A chilling portrait emerged.Virginia called herself a practical nurse, but people had dark memories of her ""care."" They recalled her three-year-old daughter, her husband, and her mother - all of whom died while alone with Virginia. A series of fires, thefts, poisonings, and insurance policies ran through her past. Keeney also discovered that both of Virginia's sons had been charged with murder.As Keeney was piecing the facts together, he realized he had uncovered a remorseless killer, one who beat the system for twenty years, collecting insurance along the way.Former prosecutor David Heilbroner, author of the highly acclaimed book Rough Justice, spent two-and-a-half years retracing Keeney's investigation, preserving accounts of many witnesses whose voices were never heard at Virginia's extraordinary two-month murder trial - a trial that literally took the jury to the edge of the Big Sur cliff. In Death Benefit, he crafts a meticulous account of both a killer's life and a Kentucky lawyer's dedication to decency and courage triumphant over evil. Death Benefit belongs to that rare breed of books - a powerful human drama and a true-life courtroom thriller."; Social Science , General;Harmony;5.64;February;1993
Making War;By Lehman, John;Former Secretary of the Navy John Lehman here confronts one of the momentous issues of American history and the American present--the contending prerogatives of the president and Congress in making war.Lehman, a lively controversialist and scholar, examines the history of American military decision making from the Revolutionary period to the Gulf War. Whose power is it to declare war, to carry it out, and to sustain its course and bring it to an end? In addressing these major constitutional questions, Lehman is vibrantly contemporary, too, writing as a government insider to offer a exceptionally vivid perspective on Operation Desert Storm and recent military actions in Grenada, Libya, Lebanon, and Panama. Arguing vehemently for the primacy of presidential over congressional power, Lehman adds crucial new details to our understanding of the post-Vietnam era of American politics.Characteristically, Lehman pulls no punches. He sheds provocative new light on congressional investigations into Watergate and Iran-Contra, authoritatively demonstrating the ways in which Congress has created crippling impediments to presidential power. Yet he provides a fresh understanding of the essential role Congress must play in committing the nation to war, and he enumerates how presidents from Jefferson to Bush have interpreted--and misinterpreted--the powers grated them as commander in chief.John Lehman's enlightening new book makes a invaluable contribution as to whether responsible judgments will be made if and when the nation must again confront the crucial decision of making war.; Law , General;Scribner;4.99;June;1992

F. Scott Fitzgerald (Literary Lives);By Mizener, Arthur;"The unending fascination of F. Scott Fitzgerald lies partly in the fact that his tragic life was like the plots of his own novels. Many famous and brilliant writers have led withdrawn, prosaic, uneventful lives; but Fitzgerald and his wife, Zelda, existed almost wholly in the real, external world--active, social, sadly typical of that frantic time in which he experienced instant success and fame, followed by a long decline and failure. Arthur Mizener is well known as the author of the first full-scale biography of Fitzgerald. In this book, Professor Mizener looks at the facts of Fitzgerald's short life, offering insights into the subtle way in which actual events were transformed and woven into the novels. With the aid of contemporary photographs from all stages of Fitzgerald's career he tells the human story and provides an important assessment of Fitzgerald's achievement."; Biography & Autobiography , Literary;Thames & Hudson;4.99;June;1987

Living With Cannibals And Other Womens Adventures;By Slung, Michele and Lindbergh, Reeve (INT);"The spirit of adventure sweeps through the chapters of this exciting volume as we encounter the inspiring, sometimes tragic, often humorous tales of adventurous women -- from the 18th century to the 21st century.  Selected from National Geographic's rich archives, this colorful group portrait pairs female adventurers of the past with their contemporary counterparts -- in a ""then and now"" approach.  You'll meet Arctic explorers -- an American heiress who crisscrossed ice fields seven decades ago, along with a celebrated New Zealander who skied alone to both North and South Poles in the 1990s. You'll also join in the atmospheric exploits of Shannon Lucid and Amelia Earhart as they take off on those daring flights that wrote a new pages in the annals of aviation.  Tour the world with women who defied Victorian convention to venture alone among the headhunters of Borneo or to see first hand the hidden corners of Africa, India, and Japan. Witness world record-breaking moments by such latterday legends as Sylvia Earle, whose explorations of the ocean floor earned her the nickname, ""Her Royal Deepness,"" and Catherine Destivelle, the beautiful French superstar of modern mountaineering.  Featuring photographs, art, and period illustrations, as well as an introduction by Reeve Lindbergh and a 1,500-year time line of women's adventuring, Living With Cannibals offers vivid testimony to the wanderlust, daring, and determination of these intrepid journeyers.  Whether kayaking remote Tibetan rivers or bottle-feeding baby orangutans, bicycling to India or battling icebergs off the coast of Greenland, each woman profiled here demonstrates her unswerving devotion to a dream."; Travel , Special Interest , Adventure;National Geographic;5.29;July;2000
A Time of Our Choosing: America's War in Iraq;By Purdum, Todd S.;The authoritative account of America’s most controversial war since Vietnam, a conflict in which “shock and awe” were not confined to the battlefield It was a war like no other the United States had ever fought. It began with the bombing of Saddam Hussein’s bunker and ended with statues of the Iraqi dictator being toppled in downtown Baghdad, and it marked a turning point in America’s relations with its enemies, its allies, and its sense of itself. Yet most Americans experienced the war as impressionistic and often confusing—the story of one battle here, one unit there, a report from one city, then another, without the larger context we so urgently needed. Each reporter had his “slice” of the war, it seemed, but no one had the whole story or the broad view.A Time of Our Choosing fills that gap brilliantly, drawing on the unparalleled resources and reportage of The New York Times. Todd S. Purdum, one of the paper’s most gifted storytellers, traces the war in Iraq from the first rumblings after 9/11, to the diplomatic recriminations at the United Nations, to the battles themselves and their aftermath. He deftly rolls out the whole canvas before our eyes, showing how the individual “slices” fit together into a single, gripping drama.Purdum also explores the complex legacy of America’s near-unilateral action. Since the 9/11 attacks, President George W. Bush has vowed that the United States would confront its enemies “at a time of our choosing,” and Purdum shows in vivid terms what this choice has meant for our now transformed world.;History , Military , Iraq War (2003-2011);Times Books;5.47;November;2003
Rewriting History;By Morris, Dick and McGann, Eileen;"Now, for the first time, Fox News political analyst and former Clinton adviser Dick Morris turns his sharp-eyed gaze on Hillary, the longtime First Lady, current New York senator, and bestselling author. For, as he argues, no politician in America today is better aligned to become president in 2008—and none would bring more baggage to the White House—than Mrs. Clinton. In Rewriting History, Morris draws on his own long working relationship with the Clintons, as well as his trademark deep research and candid, nonpartisan analysis, to create a rebuttal to Hillary's bestselling autobiography, Living History. Morris documents how Hillary hides her true self behind a ""Hillary"" brand that is chatty, charming, giggly, and warm—but is far from her true personality.In Rewriting History, Morris pierces the mask to get at the truth behind the distortions and omissions of Hillary's memoir. Here we meet the real Hillary, both good and bad: the manager who makes the trains run on time, but also the paranoid who sees all those who disagree with her as personal enemies; the idealist, but also the ""advice addict"" easily misled by the guru of the moment. Morris describes Hillary's sense of entitlement, and warns that it may lead deep into financial scandal. And he demonstrates how Hillary dodges criticism by pretending that every attack is directed not just at her, but at every working woman in America. Ultimately, Morris argues, the Hillary Clinton of today is marketing a false front, obscuring both her wants and her assets behind the phony facade of a domestic Everywoman. But as she pursues higher office, she also faces a choice. Will she, like Bobby Kennedy, see the error of her ruthless ways, and embrace the sincere idealism she professes? Or, like Richard Nixon, will she allow the darker angels of her nature to overcome her, jeopardizing herself and the country in the process?As Rewriting History suggests, we can only hope that Hillary Clinton's past performance is no guarantee of future results."; Political Science , Political Process , General;Harper;10.75;May;2004

Girls! Girls! Girls!:  Essays on Women and Music;By Cooper, Sarah (EDT);In recent years, much attention has been lavished on the New Women of rap and rock. From rap stars such as Queen Latifah to bands such as Velocity Girls, popular music has been aggressively redefined by a new generation of women, with a startling range of musical styles. Yet, women's role in contemporary music, and in music history, extends far beyond MTV or the latest riot grrrl troupe. In Girls! Girls! Girls!, Sarah Cooper has assembled a broad- ranging collection of essays to provide an entertaining and impressionistic portrait of women and music. Whether in the form of Helen Kolawole's discussion of the bitch- bashing misogyny of gangsta rap or Caroline Sullivan's exuberant assessment of women rock critics, the volume raises, and addresses, some of the most provocative and challenging issues concerning women's active involvement in and relationship to music. From indie labels to opera queens, from symphony orchestra to salsa queen, from swing to women's music in South Asia to the confessions of a British country music fan, Girls! Girls! Girls! has something for everyone, music critics, feminists, and fans alike.; Social Science , Popular Culture;NYU Press;4.99;January;1996
The Soul of Golf;By Hallberg, William;One hot summer morning, William Hallberg, author of The Rub of the Green, set off on an odyssey across the United States to penetrate - and illuminate - the soul of golf. No course was too grand, no driving range too humble for a stop on Hallberg's unpredictable tour of America's verdant and not-so-verdant golf venues. He tackled Kiawah Island's diabolical and breathtaking Ocean Course with a party of well-heeled Southern gents. He tromped through sagebrush roughs and kikuyu bunkers in the Nevada outback. He encountered the ghost of a cherished golfing buddy during a memorable round in the Smokies. And between games he nursed his wounds, pondered his constantly mutating handicap, and commiserated with fellow golfers in dusky sports bars, greasy spoons, and rain-soaked motel parking lots.The Soul of Golf will make you laugh out loud, swallow hard in the face of painful truths, and ultimately head yet again for your favorite golf course, where fate lies in ambush.; Sports & Recreation , Golf;Fawcett;4.99;April;1997

Love Awaits: African-American Women Talk about Sex, Love, and Life;By Long, Courtney;Love. Sex. Respect. Race. Politics. Unity. Spirituality. Cultural pride. These are some of the concerns expressed by twenty-six African American women in interviews with filmmaker-writer Courtney Long about what they wish for in African American men. And these issues are only part of the main concern shared by these women: that the gap between black men and women is widening into a chasm. The straight-talking sisters in Love Awaits discuss their brothers in the hope that they are taking the first step toward building a bridge of mutual understanding, unity, and peace - and creating a common ground for love and relationship.Arranged by topic, these interviews on love, sex, and growing up in the African American culture examine with honesty and raw energy the positive and negative aspects of relations between black women and men. They explore sources of pain and of healing between the sexes, obstacles to relating and new ways of being together. Candidly expressing her needs, desires, and expectations, each woman brings her own unique experiences, viewpoint, and personality to the discussion, weaving her own strand into the vibrant tapestry of the African American experience.; Social Science , LGBT Studies , Lesbian Studies;Bantam;4.99;January;1995

Empowering Technology: Implementing a U.S. Strategy;By Branscomb, Lewis M. (EDT);"Technology policy - whether we should have one and what form such a policy should take - was a core issue of the 1992 presidential campaign, and in February 1993 the Clinton administration confirmed that fostering new technologies will be a critical part of its agenda for redirecting the American economy. To help orient the inevitable debates on this agenda, experts from Harvard's Center for Science and International Affairs here examine a set of key issues and problems that, taken together, define the scope and limits of such a policy.Among the topics discussed are the new relationship between federal and state governments implied by the administration's proposals, the usefulness of the concept of ""critical technologies"" for setting priorities, the creation of new missions for the national laboratories (particularly the three weapons laboratories), the changing nature of the social contract between the government and research universities, the problems that will confront the creation of a national information infrastruc­ture, the best ways to promote small- ­and medium-sized ""driver"" companies as well as civilian research and development generally, and the relationship between education and the requirements for work in the twenty-first century.Lewis M.

Their investigation takes them to the edge of a simmering cauldron. Flag-waving whites are picketing the Turning Stone Casino and other Oneida-owned businesses. Indians are cruising with guns in their cars. Added to the dangers of race war is the presence of all the money-grubbing interests drawn to a lucrative casino.

Art of the Gold Rush;By National Museum of American Art (U. S.) (COR), Driesbach, Janice Tolhurst, Jones, Harvey, Holland, Katherine Church, Oakland Museum (COR), and Crocker Art Museum (COR);The California Gold Rush captured the get-rich dreams of people around the world more completely than almost any event in American history. This catalog, published in celebration of the sesquicentennial of the 1848 discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill, shows the vitality of the arts in the Golden State during the latter nineteenth century and documents the dramatic impact of the Gold Rush on the American imagination.Among the throngs of gold-seekers in California were artists, many self-taught, others formally trained, and their arrival produced an outpouring of artistic works that provide insights into Gold Rush events, personages, and attitudes. The best-known painting of the Gold Rush era, C.C. Nahl's Sunday Morning in the Mines (1872), was created nearly two decades after gold fever had subsided. By then the Gold Rush's mythic qualities were well established, and new allegories—particularly the American belief in the rewards of hard work and enterprise—can be seen on Nahl's canvas. Other works added to the image of California as a destination for ambitious dreamers, an image that prevails to this day. In bringing together a range of art and archival material such as artists' diaries and contemporary newspaper articles, The Art of the Gold Rush broadens our understanding of American culture during a memorable period in the nation's history.; Art , Folk & Outsider Art;University of California Press;4.99;April;1998

Lincoln and Slavery;By Burchard, Peter;"Why did Abraham Lincoln approve of compromises over slavery?  How could he have thought that most black Americans would accept voluntary segregation as the way to freedom?  Why, in spite of Lincoln's shortcomings, did the black leader Frederick Douglass think that the president's accomplishments were more remarkable than those of the founding fathers?  In providing at least partial answers to these questions, Lincoln and Slavery gives us a fresh look at a subject often shadowed by misinformation.  Here, we follow the young Lincoln as he takes an interest in the law and becomes a legislator. In a series of debates with his political opponent Stephen Douglas, we hear Lincoln argue forcefully that slavery, if allowed to spread, would destroy democracy.  As Lincoln and Slavery focuses on Lincoln's years as president, we see him work on the Emancipation Proclamation -- which changed the purpose of the Civil War and welcomed black men into military service. We go with him to Gettysburg, where he reaffirms ""the proposition that all men are created equal."" We listen to him, only weeks before his death, as he proclaims that the Union armies will keep fighting ""until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid for by another drawn with the sword.""  This is the story of a great American, a man who hated slavery and believed, above all else, that democracy was the best hope for humankind -- in his time and in all the years to come."; Young Adult Fiction , Historical , United States , General;Atheneum Books for Young Readers;5.3;June;1999

Expanding upon her pathbreaking work in The Reproduction of Mothering and combining significant new writings with previously published essays, Nancy J. Chodorow elucidates how the unconscious awareness of self and gender we develop from earliest infancy continues to shape both our experience as men and women and the patterns of inequality and difference that exist throughout our society and culture. ""Chodorow is an exceptionally intelligent and serious writer, and her contribution to the debate on gender and sexual identity is substantial. . . . Through her deepening reflections on gender issues and her study of the reality of women's lives, Ms. Chodorow puts both Freud and feminism to the test.""—Stuart Schneiderman, New York Times Book Review ""In [a book] teeming with ideas, Chodorow . . . explores issues such as the influence of maternal care on the emerging self, social oppression of women on the basis of presumed gender differences, Oedipal conglict, heterosexual identification, and women analysts.""—Publishers Weekly ""These essays are as good a statement of the issues in feminist psychoanalysis or psychoanalytic feminism as I have seen, reflecting the knowledge and questions of an 'insider' in both areas.

Moral Freedom: The Search for Virtue in a World of Choice;By Wolfe, Alan;How Americans describe their guiding principles in an exhilarating and unnerving new era of moral freedom. What is the difference between right and wrong? What does it mean to lead a good life? How binding is the marriage vow? What are your obligations to an employer? To your friends? To yourself? Is it always immoral to tell a lie? Eminent sociologist and public intellectual Alan Wolfe asked Americans around the country such questions in order to determine how we really think about morality today. Wolfe discovered that while values have changed, they are far from absent. Americans of all stripesfrom the most radical to the most traditionalwant to lead a good life, but in almost every case they are determined to decide for themselves what a good life means. Focusing on traditional virtues of loyalty, honesty, self-restraint, and forgiveness, Moral Freedom reveals the complexities of living in a society where rather than simply accepting strict conventions, each individual struggles to forge a moral life.; Philosophy , Ethics & Moral Philosophy;W W Norton & Co Inc;5.29;April;2001

Mac OS X Hacks goes beyond the peculiar mix of man pages and not-particularly-helpful Help Center, pulling the best tips, tricks, and tools from the Mac power users and Unix hackers themselves.The collection reflects the real-world know how and experience of those well steeped in Unix history and expertise, sharing their no-nonsense, sometimes quick-and-dirty solutions to administering and taking full advantage of everything a Unix desktop has to offer: Web, Mail, and FTP serving, security services, SSH, Perl and shell scripting, compiling, configuring, scheduling, networking, and hacking.  Add to that the experience of die-hard Macintosh users, customizing and modifying their hardware and software to meet their needs: System Preferences, GUI mods and tweaks, hardware tips, vital shareware and freeware, AppleScript, AppleTalk and equivalents, keyboard modifiers, and general Macintosh-style tomfoolery.Each Hack can be read easily in a few minutes, saving countless hours of searching for the right answer.  Mac OS X Hacks provides direct, hands-on solutions that can be applied to the challenges facing both those meeting the Mac for the first time and long-time users delving into Mac OS X and its Unix underpinnings.Mac OS X Hacks is the third in O'Reilly's new Hacks Serier which aims to begin reclaiming the term ""hacking"" for the good guys.  In recent years, the term has come to be associated with those nefarious black hats who break into computers to snoop, steal information or disrupt Internet traffic.  But the term originally had a more benign meaning, and you'll still hear it used this way whenever developers get together.  Our new Hacks books are written in the spirit of the true hackers -- the people who drive innovation."; Computers , Security , General;O'Reilly Media;5.29;March;2003
Blast from the Past: A Novel (Kinky Friedman Novels);By Friedman, Kinky;"Now, at last, it can be revealed! The TRUTH behind the legend!  That Kinky Friedman... Where did he come from? How did he get that way? Shouldn't someone have called 911 long ago?   Now, in Blast from the Past, nationally bestselling author Kinky Friedman has searched his failing memory and has come up with a novel about his early days in New York City and how Kinky Friedman, the down-and-out star-crossed country music performer, became Kinky Friedman, the down-and-out star-crossed ace detective.  In this prequel to his earlier novels, one which gives new meaning to the term ""retro,"" Kinkster fans are given the definitive answer to two of literature's great burning questions: Where the hell did those weird characters come from anyway? And what about that puppet head?  Of course, it's not just Kinky himself who gets retroed, but all the Village Irregulars as well -- Ratso, Rambam, and McGovern -- who are glimpsed in the nascent stage, as is the ever-luscious Stephanie DuPont, who blasts upon the scene as a five-year-old nymphet in patent-leather spikes.   Imagine it's the '70s. Imagine the Lone Star Cafe is still alive and well. Imagine that it's still okay to do drugs, still okay to have unprotected sex, still okay to paddle a brat and spank a monkey. And imagine you are there, in the '70s, at the Lone Star, sipping a brew with the Kinkster, a much younger, even kinkier Kinky -- uncouth, unshaped, unrepentant, and frequently unconscious.  But lest you think that Blast from the Past is all nostalgia, be assured that Kinky has supplied a bang-up plot as well, much of which revolves around the mystery of who this guy Tim is who Judy exclaims about while being hosed by Kinky, and the question of whether or not the Feds have found Abbie Hoffman, who has been playing hide-and-seek in Ratso's apartment. Or something like that.  As always, it's great, unpredictable fun from a true original, whose ""Irreverent, bawdy and often outrageous adventures are like no others,"" as says The San Diego Union-Tribune. In Blast from the Past, you'll find the Kinkster in top form and at his most outrageous."; Fiction , Action & Adventure;Simon & Schuster;4.99;September;1998

Breakthroughs (The Great War, Book 3);By Turtledove, Harry;Is it the war to end all wars - or war without end? What began as a conflict in Europe, when Germany unleashed a lightning assault on its enemies, soon spread to North America, as a long-simmering hatred between two independent nations explodes. Twice in fifty years the Confederate States of America has humiliated their northern neighbor. Now revenge may at last be at hand.Under the leadership of Teddy Roosevelt, and following a general named Custer - military genius or madman? - the United States are fighting a war on two fronts in 1917. In the north, from the Pacific to Quebec, U.S. forces in the air and on land are locked in battle against Canada and Great Britain. To the south, at the heart of a line that stretches from the Gulf of California to the Atlantic, Custer intends to do what none of his predecessors had ever managed: to smash through the Confederate barbwire entrenchments in Tennessee.Here are leather-jacketed daredevil pilots flying unproved fighters into anti-aircraft fire. Here is a melee on the sea, as U.S. sailors duel Confederate submariners, while the English, French, and Japanese surface navies vie for control of the shipping lanes. In Harry Turtledove's incredibly imagined alternate history, the Great War is played out over a cast of vivid characters. Amid the sound and fury of battle, as nonaligned nation-states choose sides and politicians spew bombast far from the front lines, The Great War: Breakthroughs captures a world war at an apocalyptic turning point. Victory is at hand - but at a price that may be worse than war itself.; Fiction , Action & Adventure;Del Rey;6.12;August;2000

Lydia Cassatt Reading the Morning Paper;By Chessman, Harriet Scott;Harriet Scott Chessman takes us into the world of Mary Cassatt's early Impressionist paintings through Mary's sister Lydia, whom the author sees as Cassatt’s most inspiring muse. Chessman hauntingly brings to life Paris in 1880, with its thriving art world. The novel’s subtle power rises out of a sustained inquiry into art’s relation to the ragged world of desire and mortality. Ill with Bright’s disease and conscious of her approaching death, Lydia contemplates her world narrowing. With the rising emotional tension between the loving sisters, between one who sees and one who is seen, Lydia asks moving questions about love and art’s capacity to remember. Chessman illuminates Cassatt’s brilliant paintings and creates a compelling portrait of the brave and memorable model who inhabits them with such grace.

In her hometown, Hallie reconnects with a beloved childhood friend, Rose, who is now a writer and pregnant with her third child.

Conversations About Bernstein;By Burton, William Westbrook (EDT);"With the death of Leonard Bernstein in 1990, the music world lost one of its most vital forces. Bernstein's death came only a matter of days after he had announced his retirement from conducting, and the news was received with incredulity and shock around the world. A composer, a conductor, a pianist, host of the wildly popular Omnibus series and theYoung People's Concerts, Bernstein was in many ways a pioneer. The first American to conduct at La Scala (Cherubini'sMedea in 1953 with Maria Callas), and the first to take over a major American orchestra when he became Music Director of the New York Philharmonic in 1958, he gave a new respectability to the idea of the American-born-and-trained musician. As Tim Page wrote in Newsday after Bernstein's death, Bernstein's decision to make a career in America was ""a declaration of independence"" for his generation of American musicians.In Conversations About Bernstein, friends, critics, and collaborators, as well as the world-class musicians who shared the stage with Bernstein, remember the private artist behind the public flamboyance and acclaim. In an unprecedented series of interviews with author William Westbrook Burton, they reveal how Bernstein worked, the perennial conflicts in his personal and professional lives, and why he made the choices that he did. Here are not only the great triumphs--the stunning debuts as conductor with the New York or the Vienna Philharmonics, the rapturous reception of the incomparableWest Side Story--but the moments of self-doubt and crushing disappointment as well. Composer Lukas Foss remembers Bernstein as a preternaturally poised young student under pressure to work in his father's beauty parlor business. FormerNew York Times critic Harold Schonberg maintains that his unrelentingly negative reviews of Bernstein's performances made no difference to Bernstein's career. Carol Lawrence recreates the historic first production ofWest Side Story. Conductor John Mauceri recalls with deep affection Bernstein's sometimes maddening methods of conducting and composing, and members of Bernstein's orchestras as well as opera stars Christa Ludwig, Frederica Von Stade, Jerry Hadley, and renowned cellist Mstislav Rostropovich share recollections of memorable recordings and performances.A portrait emerges of a remarkably generous conductor and musical theatre collaborator adored worldwide, who nonetheless believed at the end of his life that his single most cherished ambition--the creation of a serious masterwork--remained unrealized. Candid, entertaining, and often moving, Conversations About Bernstein is a deeply enjoyable look at the career of arguably the most famous musician of our time."; Music , Reference;Oxford University Press;5.29;March;1995

At War with Ourselves: Why America Is Squandering Its Chance to Build a Better World;By Hirsh, Michael;"As correspondent for Newsweek, Michael Hirsh has traveled to every continent, reporting on American foreign policy. Now he draws on his experience to offer an original explanation of America's role in the world and the problems facing the nation today and in the future.        Using colorful vignettes and up-close reporting from his coverage of the first two post-Cold War presidents, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, Hirsh argues that America has a new role never before played by any nation: it is the world's Uberpower, overseeing the global system from the air, land, sea and, increasingly, from space as well. And that means America has a unique opportunity do what no great power in history has ever done--to perpetuate indefinitely the global system it has built, to create an international community with American power at its center that is so secure it may never be challenged. Yet Americans are squandering this chance by failing to realize what is at stake. At the same time that America as a nation possesses powers it barely comprehends, Americans as individuals have vulnerabilities they never before imagined. They desperately need the international community on their side.      In an era when democracy and free markets have become the prevailing ideology, Hirsh argues, one of America's biggest problems will be ""ideological blowback""--facing up to the flaws and contradictions of its own ideals. Hence, for example, the biggest threat to political stability is not totalitarianism, but the tricky task of instituting democracy in the Arab world without giving Islamic fundamentalists the reigns of power. The only way for Washington to avoid accusations of hypocrisy is to allow the global institutions it has built, like the U.N., to do the hard work of promoting U.S. values."; Political Science , Security (National & International);Oxford University Press;4.99;June;2003

The Second Shift;By Hochschild, Arlie Russell and Machung, Anne;"In this landmark study, sociologist Arlie Hochschild takes us into the homes of two-career parents to observe what really goes on at the end of the ""work day."" Overwhelmingly, she discovers, it's the working mother who takes on the second shift.Hochschild finds that men share housework equally with their wives in only twenty percent of dual-career families. While many women accept this inequity in order to keep peace, they tend to suffer from chronic exhaustion, low sex drive, and more frequent illness as a result. The ultimate cost is the forfeited health and happiness of both partners, and often the survival of the marriage itself.With a new afterword by the author, this groundbreaking study is as relevant today as when it was first published."; Social Science , Women's Studies;Avon Books;5.29;October;1990

Joe Morgan: A Life in Baseball;By Falkner, David and Morgan, Joe;"Back-to-back Most Valuable Player and World Series winner Joe Morgan entered the Hall of Fame in 1990 on the first ballot, a ""good little player"" who achieved greatness by hard work, dedication, and baseball intelligence. In this entertaining book, be tells the story of his extraordinary life in baseball and offers provocative insights into the game's past, present, and future.The box score? The most complete player of his time has given us the complete baseball book, from the grit of the infield dirt on his spikes as he turned a double play against a charging Frank Robinson to no-holds-barred banter in the locker room with Johnny Bench, Tony Perez, and Pete Rose, from the frustration of seeing good teams destroyed by racism and incompetence to the triumph of winning it all with the most talented, and the smartest, team in baseball, Cincinnati's Big Red Machine.In vivid anecdotes, Joe Morgan recounts starting out in the minor leagues in the still-segregated South, the only black player on the Durham Bulls; earning a trip to the majors with the expansion Colt 45s (soon to become the Houston Astros), a rag tag collection of over-the-hill veterans and inexperienced youngsters with its own band of outlaws, ""The Dalton Gang""; honing his game with the help of all-time-great Nellie Fox; competing against the likes of Willie Mays, Sandy Koufax, Bob Gibson, Tom Seaver, Reggie Jackson, Willie McCovey, and Willie Stargell; winning back to back MVP awards and World Series; dramatic seasons with the Philadelphia Phillies, San Francisco Giants, and Oakland A's; and being welcomed into the Hall of Fame by his childhood idol, Ted Williams.At the heart of the book is the tale of how four big, combative egos - Johnny Bench, Tony Perez, Pete Rose, and Morgan himself - learned to win together under Sparky Anderson's leadership, transforming the Cincinnati Reds into the Big Red Machine, the most successful team of the 1970s. Joe Morgan shows us how the Reds dominated games with sheer baseball smarts as well as awesome physical skill, and he gives us up-close views of his teammates, including Sparky Anderson's gift for molding individuals into a team dedicated to winning, Johnny Bench's flair for the dramatic play, Tony Perez's unquenchable will-to-win in the clutch, and Pete Rose's tumultuous experiences on and off the field. It's all here, from the day Dave Concepcion took a ride in the locker room dryer to George Foster's reply to an accusation of cheating: ""I don't cork my bat. I cork my arm.""Bringing his unparalleled feel for winning baseball right up to the present, Morgan also gives us hard-hitting commentary on the current state of the game, discussing why today's teams play brain dead, what keeps Rickey Henderson and other stars from being as great as they think they are, why good teams self-destruct so easily, why the new commissioner will find it hard to act ""in the best interests of baseball,"" and how baseball ought to deal with such issues as expansion, free agency, and minority hiring. His controversial prescription for baseball's future - the appointment of a baseball ambassador empowered to negotiate with both players and owners for the good of the game - will spark lively debate all through the season and beyond.The final tally: here is a baseball read with the spark that made Joe Morgan the winningest player of his time.";;W W Norton & Co Inc;8.0;April;1993

Wilson's Ghost: Reducing the Risk of Conflict, Killing, and Catastrophe in the 21st Century;By McNamara, Robert S. and Blight, James G.;"Woodrow Wilson's vision of a collective international action to resist aggressive conflict after the carnage of World War I failed tragically. Over 160 million people died in war during the 20th century, and in Wilson's Ghost, Robert S. McNamara and James G. Blight put forth a decisive, multi-faceted action program for realizing Wilson's dream during this century. The plan begins with a moral imperative that establishes as a major goal of foreign policy across the globe the avoidance of war. To that end,enforcement entails only multilateral intervention on the part of the United States; full reconciliation with Russia and China to integrate those nations into relations with the other Great Powers; restructuring the United Nations to greater effectiveness; defining and deterring war crimes; creating UN enforcement; and finally, reducing nuclear danger by eliminating the huge arsenal held by the United States and Russia, and by signing into law the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The authors support their plan with specific, achievable steps that can begin now to ensure a more peaceful 21st century."; History , Military , General;PublicAffairs;4.99;June;2001
Civil Wars: A Battle for Gay Marriage;By Moats, David;"In 2000 Vermont became the first state to grant gay and lesbian couples the right to join in civil unions-a groundbreaking decision that has inspired similar legislation in six states thus far. But it was not an easy victory; the ruling sparked the fiercest political conflict in the state's memory. David Moats was in the thick of it, writing a series of balanced, humane editorials that earned a Pulitzer Prize. Now he tells the intimate stories behind the battle and introduces us to all the key actors in the struggle, including the couples who first filed suit; the lawyers who spent years championing the case; and the only openly gay legislator in Vermont, who ensured victory with an impassioned, deeply personal speech on the House floor at a crucial moment. Civil Wars is a remarkable drama of democracy at work on a human scale."; Political Science , Civil Rights;Harcourt;5.89;February;2004
Jane Austen (Literary Lives Series);By Laski, Marghanita;Jane Austen sprang from the upper middle class society of late eighteenth century southern England. Orthodox in morals and religion, generally Tory in politics--this was the milieu that she describes so memorably in her novels. Indeed her environment provided her with material ideally suited to her talents: accurate observation of character, wit, dramatic intuition, an ear for realistic dialogue, and a highly disciplined formal sense. These gifts, evident in the early and satirical novels Northanger Abbey and Sense and Sensibility, found their perfect expression in the great books of her maturity, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, Emma, and Persuasion. The late novelist and critic Marghanita Laski brings to this illustrated biography the fruits of a long and loving study of Jane Austen, her work, her letters, and her time.; Biography & Autobiography , Literary;Thames & Hudson;5.29;April;1998

Wallace;By Reese, Peter;'I have brought you to the ring, now hop if you can.'Wallace's famous injunction before the battle of Falkirk is still remembered today. The first section of this major new biography deals with the history of Wallace and his time. According to legend, born and brought up in Elderslie, Wallace's courage and heroism during Scotland's darkest days were instrumental in creating a sense of national identity. From the early killing of the Sheriff of Lanark, Sir William Haslerigg, through his crowning triumph at Stirling Bridge to his terrible end, Wallace was unswerving in his devotion to the cause of Scottish freedom. The brutality of his end is a testament to the fear and humiliation his name inspired in Edward I.The second section of the book studies the impact of the man and the myth on later generations. The guerrilla tactics initiated by Wallace were later used by Robert the Bruce to great success. Blind Harry's epic poem (1478) personifies the will and desire of Scottish people for independence in the figure of Wallace. Over 200 years after his death Scotland's greatest knight continues to inspire nationalists in this country and throughout the world.Peter Reese's objective and lucid text concludes with the judgement that Wallace's martyrdom was a greater legacy to the Scots than even the achievements of his lifetime. While he was alive, the power of his personality galvanised a nation. Since his death, the memory of William Wallace has endured as an inspiration for unity.; Biography & Autobiography , Historical;CAN;4.99;June;1996

Tabloid Dreams: Stories;By Butler, Robert Olen;"In his first collection since the Pulitzer Prize-winning A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain, Robert Olen Butler dazzles anew with his mastery of the short-story form and his true empathy for the denizens of the less-well-explored corners of the human condition. Though his mirthful and appropriately absurd story titles - ""Boy Born with Tattoo of Elvis,"" ""Titanic Victim Speaks Through Waterbed,"" ""Woman Uses Glass Eye to Spy on Philandering Husband,"" and ""JFK Secretly Attends Jackie Auction,"" among others - reflect Butler's genuine fondness for the outsized fancies of tabloid readers' and writers' imaginations, his ambitions are not so lighthearted or ephemeral. Once again he explores the enduring issues of cultural exile, loss, aspiration, and the search for the self. Employing a seamless mixture of high and low culture, of the surreal, the sordid, and the sad, Butler has created a frequently hilarious, always deeply moving, and profoundly American book."; Fiction , General;Henry Holt & Co;5.29;October;1996

The Little Secret That Can Change Your Life;By Davis, Joann;"With a light heart and in the nicest, most insightful way, Joann Davis invites us to stop running around in circles. If we stop working for the cheese at the end of the maze, for the biggest toys at the end of the day, who knows what we could accomplish or how we might feel? This little book is nothing less than a game plan for creating a life that counts.In the tradition of Robert Fulghum, ""The Little Secret That Can Change Your Life""* is a collection of short inspirational essays designed to help readers discover the path to a more meaningful life, one that is less about running the modern rat race of workaholism, consumerism, debt, and frustration. The book suggests that a more rewarding way of living comes when we realize that beneath the surface of life is a spiritual economy made up of virtues and values. Money and material things matter, but they aren't everything. We must be careful not to gain the world and lose our souls.""Our inner world is ours to make of what we choose. Magnificent changes can radiate out of every human heart if we so desire. So then, if you are open, brave, and willing to take the challenge, read on. See if you don't agree that there's much more to life than winning the rat race.""If every person who reads this book chooses one way to leave the rat race and passes the idea to just one other person, in no time at all our national priorities could change. Children could become more important than money. Virtue could become its own reward. Corporate greed could become passe.There are rules for rats -- Bite off more than you can chew. Act as if enough isn't -- ever. View life as part of work, instead of work as a part of life. Follow them all, win the race, and you'll still be -- a rat There are rules for mice -- No fighting, no biting. You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.

He lost both his legs and his job in the line of duty as a policeman.Baal Curran is a high school senior, full of the promise and heartbreak of her first love, and her first loss. The needle scarring from her diabetes drove away the only boy ever to care for her. Now she has retreated inside herself, determined never to be hurt again.Both of them have discovered Killobyte, an exciting new fantasy adventure game that promises to be the most realistic experience they can imagine. Once again Walter can have the strong legs of a hero, charging through a castle to rescue a captive princess, battling a ferocious dragon, matching wits with a sorcerer. With her face hidden behind a fictional character, Baal can forget her shyness and her fear that others will shrink away from her because of her lifetime of illness. She can laugh and have adventures, and dare to care about someone else again.But Killobyte is more real than even its creators can have dreamed. Within its programming lurks a flaw that has allowed one demented player a kind of power its creators never intended - a power that can trap and ""kill"" Walter and Baal time after time in the game scenarios.Of course, as long as this game of cat and mouse is kept within the world of computer-generated adventures, it's only a frustration. Walter and Baal seem never to win. But as the games continue, they begin to wonder whether the power of this mystery player can extend outside the framework of the game....The mystery player is out for power - and the power he has in mind is far more than just racking up points against fictional opponents.

Name All the Animals: A Memoir;By Smith, Alison;A luminous, poignant true story, Alison Smith's stunning first book, Name All the Animals, is an unparalleled account of grief and secret love: the tale of a family clinging to the memory of a lost child, and a young woman struggling to define herself in the wake of his loss.As children, siblings Alison and Roy Smith were so close that their mother called them by one name: Alroy. But on a cool summer morning when Alison was fifteen, she woke to learn that Roy, eighteen, was dead. This is Smith's extraordinary account of the impact of that loss -- on herself, on her parents, and on a deeply religious community.At home, Alison and her parents sleepwalk in shifts. Alison hoards food for her lost brother, hides in the backyard fort they built together, and waits for him to return. During the day, she breaks every rule at Our Lady of Mercy School for Girls, where the baffled but loving nuns offer prayer, Shakespeare, and a job running the switchboard. In the end, Alison finds her own way to survive: a startling and taboo first love that helps her discover a world beyond the death of her brother.An intimate book written in clear-eyed prose, Name All the Animals announces a brilliant new writer with a keen insight into the emotional life of the American family, the power of sibling love and loyalty, and the excruciating joy of first, forbidden love. Smith tells the story through her own fifteen-year-old eyes, with such expert pacing and narrative suspense that readers will find the book hard to put down.Heartbreaking but hopeful, this is ultimately a book less about loss than it is about love -- about the excitement and anguish of Alison's first love, about her parents' enduring romance, about a community's passion for its faith, and about a well-loved boy who dies too young. A fiercely beautiful, redemptive book, it is sure to be a classic.; Biography & Autobiography , Personal Memoirs;Scribner;5.29;January;2004

Deliver Us from Evil: Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism;By Hannity, Sean;"Nearly three years have passed since that tragic day in September. Since then, our wounds have healed, but our senses and memories have dulled.At first, the nation rallied behind its leader. But by the time the confrontation with Iraq presented itself, our courage and moral certainty seemed to fade in the face of partisan bickering and posturing.Now the political left and the Democratic Party are trying to use the demanding aftermath of the war to exploit our national cause for their own political advantage.How could we allow ourselves to forget so soon?--from Deliver Us from EvilSean Hannity's first blockbuster book, the New York Times bestseller Let Freedom Ring, cemented his place as the freshest and most compelling conservative voice in the country. As the host of the phenomenally successful Hannity & Colmes on the Fox News Channel and The Sean Hannity Show on ABC Radio, Hannity has won a wildly devoted fan base. Now he brings his plainspoken, take-no-prisoners style to the continuing War on Terror abroad -- and liberalism at home -- in Deliver Us from Evil.""Evil exists,"" Hannity asserts. ""It is real, and it means to harm us."" And in these pages he revisits the harsh lessons America has learned in confronting evil in the past and the present, to illuminate the course we must take in the future. Tracing a direct line from Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin through Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden, he reminds us of the courage and moral clarity of our great leaders. And he reveals how the disgraceful history of appeasement has reached forward from the days of Neville Chamberlain and Jimmy Carter to corrupt the unrepentant leftists of the modern Democratic Party -- from Howard Dean and John Kerry to Bill and Hillary Clinton. As Americans face the ongoing war against terrorists and their state sponsors around the world, Sean Hannity reminds us that we must also cope with the continuing scourge of accommodation and cowardice at home. With his trademark blend of passion and hard-hitting commentary, he urges Americans to recognize the dangers of putting our faith in toothless ""multilateralism"" when the times call for decisive action. For only through strong defense of our freedoms, at home and around the world, can we preserve America's security and liberty in the dangerous twenty-first century."; Political Science , Terrorism;William Morrow;4.99;February;2004

The New York Public Library's Books of the Century;By New York Public Library (COR), Diefendorf, Elizabeth (EDT), and Bryan, Diana (ILT);"What are the books that helped shape and define the last hundred years? This was the question put to the librarians of The New York Public Library as part of the Library's 100th anniversary celebration. Which books had influenced the course of events for good or ill? Which interpreted new worlds? Or delighted millions of readers? Their answers to these questions formed ""Books of the Century,"" a highly popular exhibit during the Library's centennial celebration (1895 to 1995), highlighting an exhilarating collection of important works by some of the greatest writers of our times.     Now, the companion volume, The New York Public Library's Books of the Century takes readers on a thought-provoking tour of the last hundred years, through the medium of the printed word. Here readers will find over 150 pivotal works organized into topical categories, reflecting themes that have informed the century, among them ""Mind & Spirit,"" ""Protest & Progress,"" ""Women Rise,"" or ""Nature's Realm."" Each is introduced with a brief commentary illuminating the themes and issues the books in that section address, followed by an annotation for each title offering a brief description and a key to its significance.  The range of books is remarkable, embracing Chekhov's Three Sisters and Bram Stoker's Dracula, as well as Galbraith's The Affluent Society and Durkheim's Suicide, or Timothy Leary's The Politics of Ecstasy and W.E.B. Du Bois's The Souls of Black Folk. Readers will find many illuminating juxtapositions. In ""Utopias & Dystopias,"" for instance, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Peter Pan, and Lost Horizon are in the unexpected company of Nineteen Eighty-four, A Clockwork Orange, Brave New World, and The Time Machine. The century's darkest moments are mirrored in ""War, Holocaust, Totalitarianism,"" where we find Koestler's Darkness at Noon, Hersey's Hiroshima, Anne Frank's Diary, and Dee Brown's Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee. But the volume ends on a happier note, with ""Optimism, Joy, Gentility,"" and such wonderful works as Helen Keller's The Story of My Life, Shaw's Pygmalion, Margaret Wise Brown's Goodnight Moon, and Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird.      Illustrated throughout with imaginative paper cut-out murals by artist Diana Bryan, The New York Public Library's Books of the Century is a reflection of our times, featuring both the books we love--whether The Cat in the Hat or Ulysses--and books like The Surgeon General's Report or Mein Kampf that, for better or worse, have been an inescapable part of our century. ""For 100 years, the librarians of The New York Public Library have shared our passion for books with a diverse and literate public,"" said curator and editor Elizabeth Diefendorf. ""That experience has given us a unique perspective in making our choices for the books of the century. We hoped that visitors to the exhibition, and now the readers of this book, will be drawn into our choices and reflect on what their own selections would be."""; Reference , Bibliographies & Indexes;Oxford University Press;5.29;October;1997

Letters to a Fiction Writer;By Busch, Frederick (EDT);"Brilliant inspiration from some of our most renowned and respected fiction writers on the craft of writing and the writing life. ""Abandon the idea that you are ever going to finish . . . write just one page for each day. . . . Never correct or rewrite until the whole thing is down,"" instructs John Steinbeck. ""When your interest is engaged, i.e., in the sounds and smells of your city, you write admirably. But until these details become the envelope of a clear and legible emotion, ambition, or dilemma, the reader's interest, while respectful, will be to some extent merely polite,"" writes John Updike to Nicholas Delbanco. Andre Dubus reflects, ""I learned from Hemingway to stop each day's work in mid-sentence, while it is still going well, then to exercise the body, and not to think about the story till you go to your desk each day."" Tobias Wolff muscles a student who does not take his craft or talent seriously enough. Ray Bradbury encourages a young writer not to take the academic route. Rosellen Brown, Ann Beattie, and Joyce Carol Oates give the reader tactics for surviving the writing life. As Frederick Busch says in his introduction to this collection, ""this is a book of counsel and sustenance. . . . The readers of this book are about to receive the wisdom of those who know, from the inside of the process, what a writer might need, from time to time, to hear."""; Literary Collections , Letters;W W Norton & Co Inc;4.99;June;1999

Theorizing Feminism: Parallel Trends In The Humanities And Social Sciences [Aug 18, 1994] Stewart, Abby J;By Herrmann, Anne C. and Stewart, Abigail J. (EDT);In the past two decades, feminist scholars have produced an abundance of theoretical writing in humanities and social science disciplines. The result is a body of work that is extraordinarily rich, hard to keep up with, and extremely difficult to teach.With the appearance of Theorizing Feminism: Parallel Trends in the Humanities and Social Sciences, the first genuinely interdisciplinary anthology of significant contributions to feminist theory, teachers will finally have a volume that does justice to their topic. Creatively edited, with insightful introductory material, this timely reader illuminates the historical development of feminist theory as well as the current state of the field.Emphasizing common themes and interests in the humanities and social sciences, the editors have chosen those topics that have been central to feminist theory in many disciplines, that remain relevant to current debates, and that reflect the interests of a diverse community of thinkers.The contributors include leading figures from psychology, literary criticism, sociology, philosophy, anthropology, art history, law, and economics. This is the ideal text for any advanced course on interdisciplinary feminist theory, one that fills a long-standing gap in feminist pedagogy.; Social Science , Gender Studies;Routledge;4.99;August;1994

Turning Life into Fiction;By Hemley, Robin;"With lively style, good humor and insight, Robin Hemley helps you turn all that you experience into fresh and powerful fiction.By learning to ""reimagine,"" you'll focus on translating real-world people and events into characters and scenes that happen on paper for the first time. You'll think ""what if"" instead of ""what is"" in order to take control of your material and cut loose the inhibitions of real life.In these pages, you'll learn how to hone your observation skills and fill your journal with rich and vivid details. (Because, as Hemley writes, ""Life is in the details, and so is good fiction."") You'll see how to decide which ideas to bring to fiction and which ones to let go. And you'll learn how to: find the right form - novel, short story, vignette, memoir - for the story you want to tell; use ""triggers"" to start your reader's imagination rolling; keep your fiction emotionally honest by making the right choices between ""the way it happened"" and what the story dictates (ask ""Is it believable?"", not ""Did it happen?""); create composites of real people and places that fit the unique needs of your story and empower your imagination; focus your fiction. Make sure everything, every character counts - and eliminate ""people who sit at the end of the bar without a role to play""; fictionalize - ethically and legally - other people's stories. Learn your rights as a writer versus their rights to privacy. (Can you use actual names? When do you need to get permission?)To illustrate how writers feed their fiction with reality, Hemley uses examples from his own work and from fiction masters of yesterday and today. At the end of each chapter, challenging exercises help you apply the basic theories and push them even further.An adventurous read, Turning Life Into Fiction will help you create fiction that's just as strange and wonderful and ""real"" as the life that inspires it."; Language Arts & Disciplines , General;Story Press;5.29;September;1994

The Ships;By Quesada, Roberto and St. Martin, Hardie (TRN);"Nothing is more exciting than the appearance of a new writer on the scene, opening new vistas on to a previously untraveled terrain. Roberto Quesada, the youngest and freshest new voice from Latin America, has been hailed by Latin American critics as ""one of our most talented and original new writers"" (Ramon Luis Acevedo) and "":.. among the most important latin American writers"" (German Vargas).A novel of Central America, The Ships describes the occasional triumphs of daily life, usually in the form of silent laughter in a world of near poverty. It charts the progress of a young writer named Guillermo in the Honduran coastal town of La Ceiba. His nights alternate between falling deeply in love and loveless sexual escapades. His days are spent harvesting pineapples under a hot sun in the employ of the Standard Fruit Company. In the background there is a workers' strike at the plantation, a dance in La Ceiba, radio reports of the revolution going on in Nicaragua only a few hours' drive south, and the drone of American helicopters overhead. Quesada's world is topsy-turvy only in the sense that here human values of love and friendship dwarf the ostensibly much-larger corporate, military, and geopolitical issues."; Fiction , General;Four Walls Eight Windows;5.0;September;1992

Magazine Writing That Sells;By McKinney, Don;"You're about to embark on an article-writing adventure.In this book, Don McKinney - editor, freelance writer, instructor - helps you work toward a higher quality of writing, to better your chances of placing articles with a higher quality of magazine.You'll begin with the idea. Article ideas are everywhere - but often buried, like mountains under molehills. McKinney helps you unearth yours and advises you in matching it to a magazine. And he shows you how to sell your article - before writing it - by creating a query letter sure to catch an editor by the imagination and intellect.Once you've got the nod, you'll talk to people and dig up information. Keeping the interview on track; the tape-or-notebook question; probing sensitive areas - McKinney helps you make these conversations count. He also ushers you into the library and to reference publications that will put you on the trail to facts you need. And he gives you an overview of computer databases and what's available on-line and on CD-ROM. Talk about saving time.And then, ready with the fruits of your research, armed with supporting comments, it's time to write. This book helps you by taking you into the very core of good wordsmithing. You'll learn about:Leads - the four basic functions your opening should serve, and four general categories of effective leads. You'll see how to grab your reader and yank him into your story. And how others, including E.B. White, Dave Barry and Frank DeFord, have done that.Endings - how to close your piece so that it rings in the reader's mind. You'll analyze ten types of finishes that McKinney identifies. Listen to the resonance in the samples of work by Shana Alexander, Saul Pett, John McPhee, Rex Reed and others.Structure - how to pound and knead and shape the agglomeration of information you've collected into a well-told tale. You'll learn about four types of article structure. And you'll see how, once you've got your story's elements in their proper places, to snug them up with transitions that make the reading smooth.Sparkle - that certain something that makes your writing stand out. Explore it, learn its ingredients through McKinney's narrative; watch it at work in the examples by W.C. ""Bill"" Heinz and Joan Didion and others. You'll see what separates average writing from good writing. This book will help you grasp it.In fact, this book will help you find your writing way in many ways, large and small.One of the larger ways is through a chapter devoted to helping you write the ever popular human-interest piece. You'll find out what kinds of articles editors seek - and why, if you meet someone with a true-drama tale, you should get the story and speed your query.Another chapter puts you onto, in McKinney's words, ""articles that anyone can write."" You may have a wealth of material suitable for major magazines, right now, awaiting only your concentration and your fingers on the keys.Throughout this book, you'll find great writing examples. And in the back are profiles of accomplished magazine writers, including Maxine Rock, Barbara Raymond and Bil Gilbert; you'll gain a wealth of instruction through these essays. Following them, top editors - including Janet Chan of Redbook and Timothy Foote of Smithsonian - tell you what they want from writers.What do you want from yourself as a writer? To create solid, evocative articles? To place them in leading magazines? Of course you do."; Business & Economics , Sales & Selling , General;Writer's Digest Books;4.99;July;1994

Living the Bill of Rights: How to Be an Authentic American;By Hentoff, Nat;"Nat Hentoff is one of America's most passionate and prominent writers about civil liberties and civil rights. In Living the Bill of Rights, he has taken what is too often thought of as an abstract issue and enlivened it by focusing on representative individuals for whom the Constitution is a vital part of life. As the late Supreme Court Justice William Brennan told Hentoff, Americans need to know how ""American liberties were won—and what it takes to keep them alive."" With characteristic eloquence, Hentoff covers the full range of American life in these inspiring profiles and stories about public and private heroes—Supreme Court Justices William Brennan and William O. Douglas, Dr. Kenneth Clark, and students, teachers, lawyers, and others who challenge assaults on the Bill of Rights."; History , Americas (North, Central, South, West Indies);University of California Press;5.29;December;1999

VISIONS OF TECHNOLOGY: A Century Of Vital Debate About Machines Systems And The Human World (The Sloan Technology Series);By Rhodes, Richard (EDT);"The Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Making of the Atomic Bomb provides a unique perspective on the twentieth century through a lively collection of writings about the unexpected and paradoxical ways in which technology has changed our lives -- and will affect our future.  Technology has been the blessing and the bane of the twentieth century. Human lifespan has nearly doubled in the West, but in no century have more human beings ever been killed by new technologies of war. Improvements in agriculture have fed increasing billions, but pesticides and chemicals threaten to poison the Earth.  Does technology improve us or diminish us? Enslave us or make us free? The problems and paradoxes of technology have stirred impassioned debate, yet, despite the central role technology has played in this century, Visions of Technology is the first book to explore the rich diversity of commentary about this vital subject.  Guided by the eminent Richard Rhodes, the reader of this provocative treasury will find highlighted the views of such prominent technological figures as Henry Ford, H. G. Wells, Rachel Carson, Margaret Sanger, Aldous Huxley, John Glenn and Gordon E. Moore. Visions of Technology also features thought-provoking images -- from the first X ray to R. Crumb's comic apocalypse -- which inform this original, much-needed roundtable.  Among the gems of opinion and history of technology gathered in this volume are Henry Ford on the horseless carriage, Thorstein Veblen on the discipline of the machine, David McCullough on the Panama Canal, Billy Mitchell on air warfare, Margaret Sanger on birth control, Robert Caro on Robert Moses, Charles Lindbergh on flying, James Agee on overalls, Lieutenant General Leslie R. Groves on the Manhattan Project, J. Robert Oppenheimer on science and war, Isaac Asimov on robotics, Alva Myrdal on ""Blue Jeans and Coca-Cola,"" Joan Didion on the Hoover Dam and Julian L. Simon on the pitfalls of making predictions (of which there are many in the 214 selections that make up this book).  At once a work of cultural history and of literature, Visions of Technology is an indispensable guide to understanding the world we have created for ourselves in the twentieth century and the problems we face at its conclusion."; Science , General;Simon & Schuster;19.7;March;1999

According to Queeney: A Novel (Bainbridge, Beryl);By Bainbridge, Beryl;"Bainbridge's brilliantly imagined, universally acclaimed, Booker Prize-longlisted novel portrays the inordinate appetites and unrequited love touched off when the most celebrated man of eighteenth-century English letters, Samuel Johnson, enters the domain of a wealthy Southwark brewer and his wife, Hester Thrale. The melancholic, middle-aged lexicographer plunges into an increasingly ambiguous relationship with the vivacious Mrs. Thrale for the next twenty years. In that time Hester's eldest daughter, the neglected but prodigiously clever Queeney, will grow into young womanhood. Along the way, little of the emotional tangle and sexual tension stirring beneath the decorous surfaces of the Thrale household will escape Queeney's cold, observant eye. ""A dark, often hilarious and deeply human vision ... a major literary accomplishment.""—Margaret Atwood, Toronto Globe and Mail ""...at the end of this luminous little novel ... we feel two losses ... the personal one and the loss to civilization.""—Richard Bernstein, New York Times ""Dialogue and descriptions subtly and skillfully convey a sense not only of the period but also the personalities.""—Merle Rubin, Los Angeles Times ""[Bainbridge's] most accomplished novel so far.""—Washington Post Book World ""Majestically deft....

Nearer, My God: An Autobiography of Faith;By Buckley, William F.;"This is the story of one man's faith, told with unrivaled reflection and candor. William F. Buckley, Jr., was raised a Catholic. As the world plunged into war, and as social mores changed dramatically around him, Buckley's faith -- a most essential part of his make-up -- sustained him. In Nearer, My God, Buckley examines in searching detail the meaning of his faith, and how his life has been shaped and sustained by religious conviction.In highly personal terms, and with the wit and acuity for which he is justly renowned, Buckley discusses vital issues of Catholic doctrine and practice, and in so doing outlines for the reader both the nature of CathoLic faith and the essential role of religious belief in everyday life. In powerfully felt prose, he contributes provocatively and intelligently to the national interest in the nature of religion, the Church, and spiritual development. Nearer, My God is sure to appeal to all readers who have felt the stirrings of their own religious faith, and who want confirmation of their beliefs or who are seeking a guide to understanding their own souls. The renowned social and political commentator, William F. Buckley Jr., turns to a highly personal subject -- his faith. And he tells us the story of his life as a Catholic Christian. ""Nearer, My God"" is the most reflective, poignant, and searching of Bill Buckley's many books. In the opening chapters he relives his childhood, a loving, funny, nostalgic glimpse into pre-World War II America and England. He speaks about his religious experiences to a world that has changed dramatically. He is unafraid of revealing the most personal side of his faith. He describes, in his distinctive style, the intimacy of a trip to Lourdes, the impact on him of the searing account by Maria Valtorta of the Crucifixion, the ordination of his nephew into the priesthood, and gives a moving account of his mother's death. And there is humor, as Buckley gives a unique, hilarious view of a visit to the Vatican with Malcolm Muggeridge, Charlton Heston, Grace Kelly, and David Niven. Personal though this book is, Buckley has gone to others to examine new perspectives, putting together his own distinguished 'Forum' and leaning on the great literature of the past to illustrate his thinking on contemporary Catholic and Christian issues."; Biography & Autobiography , Religious;Harper Paperbacks;5.29;October;1998
Rekindling the Flame: How Jews Are Coming Back to Their Faith;By Osherson, Samuel;"Many Jewish men and women are creating a vibrant, enriched Judaism for our contemporary world. Psychologist and bestselling author Samuel Osherson shines a light on those who are broadening the practice of Judaism: families observing the holidays at home; intermarried couples raising their children Jewish; study groups working with and without rabbis; and people inspired by their faith to creative work and charitable action. These people are widening the doors of Judaism, creating new rituals, increasing openness to other religions, and moving this patriarchal religion toward one without authoritarian figures. And here, Osherson, beginning a new chapter in the long story of the survival of the Jewish people, has provided a handbook for Jews yearning to redefine their relationship with Judaism and seeking to rebuild the bridges between their religious and cultural heritage. For the millions of assimilated, unaffiliated, or disaffected Jews who are quietly finding their way back to their religion, this book offers new approaches to an ancient tradition."; Religion , Judaism , General;Harvest Books;5.29;September;2002
Watching, from the Edge of Extinction;By Stearns, Beverly Peterson and Stearns, Stephen C.;To those struggling on the frontlines to save endangered plants and animals, the crucial challenge is to confront the biological causes of those species’ decline. But just as threatening to their survival are obstacles erected by human politics, greed, corruption, folly, and hypocrisy. In this mesmerizing book, Beverly and Stephen Stearns tell the stories of people who have worked directly with disappearing species in Europe, Africa, North America, and Oceania. They are stories of passion and commitment, of competence and selflessness. They are also stories that alarm, for even as unheralded heroes are working to reverse what often seems to be a species’ inevitable march toward extinction, incompetent or self-interested parties are often working against them.The authors interviewed people who work with endangered species as diverse as Mediterranean monk seals, large blue butterflies, African wild dogs, native Hawaiian crows, Texas salamanders, and rare plants on Mauritius. These dedicated individuals, in discussing how they view their work, the problems they encounter, and their thoughts on the broader significance of extinction, reveal that the causes of extinction are unique to each species—sometimes subtle and complex, at other times obvious and simple. Yet an extinction always represents an irretrievable loss of evolutionary potential and a diminishing of the beauty, diversity, and value in our own lives. The dramatic lessons of this book shed new light on the problems of endangered species and offer hope that we may yet change the fate of those species that totter on the edge of extinction.; Science , Life Sciences , Evolution;Yale University Press;5.29;March;1999

The Earl of Derby, inventor of the horse race that bears his name, is the richest man in the House of Lords-and the ugliest.

Rules for Aging: A Wry and Witty Guide to Life;By Rosenblatt, Roger;"Acclaimed and beloved prize-winning essayist Roger Rosenblatt has commented on most of the trends and events of our time. His columns in Time magazine and his commentaries on PBS's News Hour with Jim Lehrer have made him a household word and a trusted friend of millions. With a wry sense of humor and inimitable wit, Rosenblatt offers here guidelines for aging that are both easy to understand and, more importantly, easy to implement.  More and more in the news today, we are hearing about phenomenal advances in the ""fight against aging."" But what Rosenblatt suggests to combat age is far more valuable than any scientific breakthrough-he breaks down the hardest part of aging, the mental anguish of growing older with fifty-four gems of funny, brilliant, wise, indispensable advice. A book to savor, a book to keep, and a book for all ages.This little guide is intended for people who wish to age successfully, or at all. . . . One may think of this work as a how-to book, akin to many health guides published these days, whose purpose is to prolong our lives and make them richer. That is the aim of my book, too. -from the IntroductionAnd this is just the start of Roger Rosenblatt's charming and thought-provoking guide to surviving the episodes that shamelessly shave years off of our lives. With a wry sense of humor and peerless wit, Rules for Aging provides guidance that is, hands down, the most practical, pleasurable and, most importantly, painless advice you'll ever receive. As Rosenblatt writes, ""When I urge you to refrain from a certain thought or course of action, I do not mean to suggest that you are in any way wrong if you do the opposite. I mean only to say that you will suffer.""Rule #1: It doesn't matterWhatever you think matters-doesn't. Follow this rule, and it will add decades to your life. It does not matter if you are late, or early; if you are here, or if you are there; if you said it, or did not say it; if you were clever, or if you were stupid; if you are having a bad hair day, or a no hair day; if your boss looks at you cockeyed; if your girlfriend or boyfriend looks at you cockeyed; if you don't get that promotion, or prize, or house, or if you do.

American Places: Encounters with History;By Meyer, Sheldon (EDT) and Leuchtenburg, William E. (EDT);"For anyone interested in history, the physical traces of the past, especially historical places, hold a special fascination. Whether it is a battlefield or the home of a notable American, there is no question that we understand the past in a different and more immediate way when we encounter it ""on the ground.""     In American Places, more than two dozen of America's most gifted historians write about their own encounters with historic places, bringing a personal viewpoint to bear on a wide variety of sites, ranging from Monticello to Fenway Park. Here James M. McPherson writes about the battlefield of Gettysburg, and how walking the ground of Pickett's Charge inspired one of his books. Kevin Starr visits the Musso & Frank Grill in Hollywood and finds many of the flavors of California history there. Joel Williamson takes a bemused tour of Elvis Presley's Graceland, and David Kennedy tells the story of the ""Pig War"" of San Juan Island, where a spat between Britain and America over a speck of land in the Pacific helped determine the shape of the U.S. and Canada. William Freehling compares two places, Charleston's Battery and New Orleans' Jackson Square, showing how each reveals the different spirit of the society that created it. And Edward Ayers talks about spending time in Cyberspace, U.S.A., a virtual place that has much in common with the America visited by Alexis de Tocqueville a century and a half ago. Other pieces include Robert Dallek on the FDR Memorial, David Hackett Fischer on the Boston Common, and William Leuchtenburg on his native borough of Queens.     American Places celebrates the career of Sheldon Meyer, who over his years at Oxford University Press has published some of our most distinguished historians, including many Pulitzer Prize and Bancroft Prize winners, virtually all of whom have contributed to this volume.";History , United States , 20th Century;Oxford University Press;4.99;November;2000

American Empire: The Center Cannot Hold;By Turtledove, Harry;It is 1924 - a time of rebuilding, from the slow reconstruction of Washington's most honored monuments to the reclamation of devastated cities in Europe and Canada. In the United States, the Socialist Party, led by Hosea Blackford, battles Calvin Coolidge to hold on to the Powell House in Philadelphia. And it seems as if the Socialists can do no wrong, for the stock market soars and America enioys prosperity unknown in a half century. But as old names like Custer and Roosevelt fade into history, a new generation faces new uncertainties.The Confederate States, victorious in the War of Secession and in the Second Mexican War but at last tasting defeat in the Great War, suffer poverty and natural calamity. The Freedom Party promises new strength and pride. But if its chief seizes the reins of power, he may prove a dangerous enemy for the hated U.S.A. Yet the United States take little note. Sharing world domination with Germany, they consider events in the Confederacy of little consequence.As the 1920s end, calamity casts a pall across the continent. With civil war raging in Mexico, terrorist uprisings threatening U.S. control in Canada, and an explosion of violence in Utah, the United States are rocked by uncertainty.; Fiction , Fantasy , Historical;Del Rey;8.79;June;2002

Dispatches from the Front: A History of the American War Correspondent;By Lande, Nathaniel;"Since the founding of the United States, war has been a recurring phenomenon in American history.  We have fought for many reasons:  independence, national unity, manifest destiny, international democracy.  Americans have fought in almost every corner of the world, from deserts to mountains to jungles.  And in every war on every front, we have paid intense attention.  Typewriter patriots, equipped with telegraphs, radio microphones, or satellite links, have been the conduit for a public eager to imagine and feel every musket fire and missile blast from Lexington to Baghdad.   In Dispatches from the Front we have unique and special dispatches from ten American wars.  In the correspondents' words ring the passion and drama of war from the American Revolution to the Persian Gulf War.  The work of Thomas Paine, Stephen Crane, Ernest Hemingway, Ernie Pyle, Edward R. Morrow, Sydney Schanberg, and more than sixty other correspondents tell us of America's wars as they happened, on the battlefield and on the home front.  Brief essays introduce each war by discussing the important changes taking place in American society and providing a series of ""national snapshots"" of the economic, political, and technological character of the world and the country at the time.  The impact of these factors on each episode of warfare is considered, followed by a focus on the experiences of the war itself.   Over the years, the words of press observers have been central in fostering wartime nationalism.  Reporters functioned as frontline poets, scratching the first impressions into the culture's consciousness. The tone and character of the press coverage shaped the nation's understanding of itself. Dispatches from the Front offers insight into the culture of the United States at each crisis point, from its beginnings to the present time."; History , Military , United States;Oxford University Press;5.76;June;1998
On Hallowed Ground: Abraham Lincoln and the Foundations of American History;By Diggins, John Patrick;In this provocative book, John Patrick Diggins, hailed by Alan Ryan in the New York Times as “one of the liveliest and most interesting of contemporary intellectual historians,” offers a sweeping reassessment of American history, emphasizing the foundational role of Abraham Lincoln’s moral and political theory. Distressed by the divisive impact of modern identity politics, Diggins argues persuasively that in the central tenets of Lincoln’s political faith--the redeeming value of labor and the rights to property and self-determination--we find the purest expression of the values that have united Americans and guided American history.With his characteristic breadth, Diggins ranges from James Madison to W. E. B. Du Bois to the movie Good Will Hunting in his examination of the often ambivalent ways in which Americans have imagined themselves and their nation. Convinced that contemporary historians have done America a grave disservice by emphasizing political divisions along the lines of class, race, and gender, Diggins points out that throughout American history there has been more that unites the American people than divides them.; History , United States , General;Yale University Press;5.51;August;2000

Why War? Ideology, Theory, and History (Campus);By Nelson, Keith L and Olin, Spencer C.;"""Instead of proposing another theory of war, their goal is a more modest one of raising the theoretical consciousness of historians. Specifically, they argue that &#39;1) ideology does influence theory, 2) historians do have ideologies as well as theories . . . about which they are not always conscious or consistent, and 3) we can better understand, compare, and evaluate what historians are saying when we comprehend their ideological and theoretical perspectives.&#39; They attempt then, to classify historical interpretations of war according to their ideological/ theoretical orientations, however covert."" --Perspective ""Nelson and Olin .. . are concerned with enhancing history&#39;s social utility by advancing its capacity to produce generalizations that can explain or predict events and are subject to empirical testing. Their exploration of historical generalization focuses on an issue itself of the highest importance, the causes of war; but their aim is also to create a model for historical generalization applicable to other issues. They argue that to understand generalizations in history, one must recognize their roots in theory, and that historians&#39; theories in turn proceed from their own ideologies. To demonstrate, they survey theories about the causes of war that have come out of conservative, liberal, and radical ideologies. . . . any historian will profit from this rigorous approach to the problem."" --Choice ""Learned and suggestive, this book clarifies much of what is already known, and points toward new ways of understanding.""--Library Journal"; Political Science , History & Theory;University of California Press;6.09;August;1980

Forgotten Children of the AIDS Epidemic (Yale Fastback Series);By Geballe, Shelley, Gruendel, Janice, and Andiman, Warren (EDT);"""Mommy, why can`t the doctors make you better?""...""You won`t be there, will you? Who`ll take care of me?""—Rachel, age 5 AIDS breaks the rules of dying. It strikes the young rather than the old, decimating families and devastating communities. It will leave as its legacy a generation of orphans—traumatized by multiple losses, isolation, stigma, and grief. By the turn of the century, more than a hundred thousand children and youth in the United States—and ten million worldwide—will lose their parents to AIDS.Written by professionals in medicine, law, social work, anthropology, psychiatry, and public policy, this volume is the first full-length look at the issues facing children whose parents and siblings are dying of AIDS: what children experience, how it affects them, how we can meet their emotional needs and help them find second families, how we counter the stigmas they face. Authors explore ways to promote resilience in these AIDS-affected children. Stories of the children and their caretakers, told in their own words, are woven throughout.Pioneering and practical, the book presents an action agenda and resource directory for our nation`s policymakers as well as for parents and those who work with children in both formal and informal settings. This book is produced in conjunction with a video, Mommy, Who`ll Take Care of Me? Forgotten Children of the AIDS Epidemic, which will be shown on PBS and is also available from Yale University Press."; Political Science , Public Policy , Social Services & Welfare;Yale University Press;4.99;January;1995
To a Distant Island: 2;By McConkey, James;In 1890 Anton Chekhov - thirty and already a famous writer - left his home and family in Moscow to travel 6,500 miles across Russia, over frozen land and sea, by train, ferry, and troika, to visit the island of Sakhalin, a penal colony off the coast of Siberia.; Fiction , Historical;Dutton Adult;5.0;June;1984
Eventide;By Haruf, Kent;One of the most beloved novels in recent years, Plainsong was a best-seller from coast to coast—and now Kent Haruf returns to the High Plains community of Holt, Colorado, with a story of even more masterful authority.When the McPheron brothers see Victoria Roubideaux, the single mother they’d taken in, move from their ranch to begin college, an emptiness opens before them—and for many other townspeople it also promises to be a long, hard winter. A young boy living alone with his grandfather helps out a neighbor whose husband, off in Alaska, suddenly isn’t coming home, leaving her to raise their two daughters. At school the children of a disabled couple suffer indignities that their parents know all too well in their own lives, with only a social worker to look after them and a violent relative to endanger them further. But in a small town a great many people encounter one another frequently, often surprisingly, and destinies soon become entwined—for good and for ill—as they confront events that sorely test the limits of their resilience and means, with no refuge available except what their own character and that of others afford them. Spring eventually does reach across the land, and how the people of Eventide get there makes for an engrossing, profoundly moving novel rich in the wisdom, humor, and humanity for which Kent Haruf is justly acclaimed.; Fiction , Psychological;Knopf;5.54;May;2004

The Green Fuse: An Ecological Odyssey;By Harte, John and Kamp, Len (ILT);"A widely respected ecological scientist and activist draws on the poet's image and his own environmental research to demonstrate the many interconnections among the world's ecosystems. John Harte takes us from Alaskan salmon runs and the Florida everglades to South Pacific coral reefs and the bleak Tibetan plateau. The result is that rare book that bridges the cultures of science and art. Lyrical, vivid portraits of natural wonders and the threats to them are combined with precise scientific accounts of natural processes and their disturbances. The Green Fuse will show nonscientists the fascination of ecological detective work and renew scientists' love for the beauty of the world under their microscopes.Harte's stories illuminate, without sermonizing, the damage to natural systems brought about by technological hubris and calculated political ruthlessness. ""The green fuse"" symbolizes the basic unity behind natural diversity. But a fuse may also be the weak link in an overloaded system or the slow burning wick on an ecological bomb. As The Green Fuse reminds us, the energies that created human liberation from nature can also be those that lead to the human destruction of nature."; Science , Life Sciences , Biology;University of California Press;5.29;April;1996

African American Women in Congress: Forming and Transforming History;By Gill, Laverne McCain;Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman in the U.S. House of Representatives, was elected in 1968. That was nearly a hundred years after the election of the first African American man to Congress and fifty years after the first woman. A quarter of a century after Chisholm's election, the first Black woman, Carol Moseley-Braun, was elected to the United States Senate. It was not until 1993, when ten additional Black women won seats in the 103rd Congress, that African American women were allowed to serve their country and their constituencies in any substantial numbers. In 1997 that historic moment will very likely be lost as congressional districts are redrawn by court order. This remarkable book by LaVerne Gill preserves the history of the struggles and accomplishments of these fifteen courageous women, and will move others to learn from and follow their example.African American Women in Congress details the life and career histories of Shirley Chisholm, Barbara Jordan, Yvonne Burke, Cardiss Collins, Katie Hall, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Maxine Waters, Barbara-Rose Collins, Carol Moseley-Braun, Corinne Brown, Carrie Meek, Cynthia McKinney, Eva Clayton, Eddie Bernice Johnson, and Sheila Jackson-Lee. Each profile contains a picture of its subject, interview material, and resumés. Arranged chronologically, the book introduces the reader to issues of vital importance to the Black community—Reconstruction, enfranchisement, lynchings and harassment, civil rights struggles, the founding of advocacy groups, the power of the Congressional Black Caucus, the creation of majority minority districts that allowed greater representation in Congress, the struggle of largely Black Washington, D.C., for representation, and the recent dismantling of past gains by a Republican majority. Gill also describes the uphill battles for social justice and the rights of women that the fifteen women had to wage even within their own political parties, political organizations, and districts.For general readers, high school and college students, and anyone interested in the political process, this book is illuminating and inspiring reading.; Political Science , American Government , Legislative Branch;Rutgers Univ Pr;5.35;January;1997
We Write for Our Own Time: Selected Essays from Seventy-Five Years of the Virginia Quarterly Review;By Burnham, Alexander (EDT);"In 1925, Edwin A. Alderman, president of the University of Virginia, fulfilled a long-held dream by establishing a magazine at the institution founded by Thomas Jefferson just over one hundred years earlier. Not only did Alderman initiate publication of the Virginia Quarterly Review, he contributed an essay to its inaugural issue.Appearing as the first selection in this new volume of nonfiction from the VQR, Alderman's ""Edgar Allan Poe and the University of Virginia"" reflects the rare combination of literary sensibility and immersion in the political and social issues of the day, which has characterized the journal throughout its seventy-five-year history. As Alderman writes, ""I may be frank and say that there was a time when Poe did not greatly appeal to me. I felt the sheer, clear beauty of his song..., but his detachment from the world of men, where my interests most centered, left me unresponsive and simply curious.... I have come, however, to see the limitations of that view, and to behold something admirable and strange and wonderful in this proud, gifted man.""While the style and diction of the contributions have changed in the years since that first spring issue, a similar clarity of thought, deep intelligence, candor, and command of language can be found in every one of the fifty one essays assembled here by Alexander Burnham. From its home at One West Range, a few doors down from Poe's own room, the VQR has welcomed to its pages scholars such as Dumas Malone and Robert Coles, and writers whose books have become international bestsellers, including Arthur C. Clarke and Frances Mayes.Included here are some of the twentieth century's most brilliant thinkers and stylists, such international literary, political, and intellectual figures as Andre Gide, D. H. Lawrence, Aldous Huxley, Evelyn Waugh, T. S. Eliot, Eleanor Roosevelt, Thomas Mann, Jean-Paul Sartre, Bertrand Russell, and Robert Graves. George F. Kennan muses on ""The Experience of Writing History,"" Henry Steele Commager asks ""Do We Have a Class Society?,"" and Edmund S. Morgan considers the aloof character of George Washington. Carlos Baker tracks Ezra Pound through Venice, and Scott Donaldson ponders ""The Jilting of Ernest Hemingway."" These leading lights share space, as they do in every volume of the journal, with lesser-known but no less talented writers ruminating on the Battle of the Bulge, the Berlin Wall, the Bomb, and Vietnam, on growing up in Hollywood and living in Charlottesville, Virginia.Writers of the South are fittingly represented by Thomas Wolfe, Mary Lee Settle, and Louis D. Rubin Jr., but a quick scan of the table of contents reveals that the VQR has never been a regional magazine. As the current editor, Staige D. Blackford writes in his preface, ""Since its inception, the Virginia Quarterly Review has tried to offer its readers a variety of essays on a variety of topics ranging from foreign affairs to domestic politics, from literature to travel, from sports to sex, from music to medicine.""On the occasion of its seventy-fifth anniversary, We Write for Our Own Time amply and entertainingly reflects what the VQR's masthead has always proclaimed as its identity: ""A National Journal of Literature and Discussion."""; Literary Criticism , Books & Reading;University of Virginia Press;5.76;March;2000

Changing Channels: Television and the Struggle for Power in Russia;By Mickiewicz, Ellen;"New in paperbackRevised and expandedDuring the tumultuous 1990s, as Russia struggled to shed the trappings of the Soviet empire, television viewing emerged as an enormous influence on Russian life. The number of viewers who routinely watch the nightly news in Russia matches the number of Americans who tune in to the Super Bowl, thus making TV coverage the prized asset for which political leaders intensely—and sometimes violently—compete. In this revised and expanded edition of Changing Channels, Ellen Mickiewicz provides many fascinating insights, describing the knowing ways in which ordinary Russians watch the news, skeptically analyze information, and develop strategies for dealing with news bias.	 Covering the period from the state-controlled television broadcasts at the end of the Soviet Union through the attempted coup against Gorbachev, the war in Chechnya, the presidential election of 1996, and the economic collapse of 1998, Mickiewicz draws on firsthand research, public opinion surveys, and many interviews with key players, including Gorbachev himself. By examining the role that television has played in the struggle to create political pluralism in Russia, she reveals how this struggle is both helped and hindered by the barrage of information, advertisements, and media-created personalities that populate the airwaves. Perhaps most significantly, she shows how television has emerged as the sole emblem of legitimate authority and has provided a rare and much-needed connection from one area of this huge, crisis-laden country to the next. 	This new edition of Changing Channels will be valued by those interested in Russian studies, politics, media and communications, and cultural studies, as well as general readers who desire an up-to-date view of crucial developments in Russia at the end of the twentieth century."; Performing Arts , Television , General;Duke University Press Books;5.62;September;1999
American Spectator's Enemies List: A Vigilant Journalist's Plea for a Renewed Red Scare;By O'Rourke, P. J. (EDT);"Written with the same acerbic wit and infectious humor that has made P. J. O'Rourke one of the most popular political satirists of all time, The Enemies List will keep you howling and his enemies scowling. From Noam Chomsky to Yoko Ono, from Peter, Paul, and Mary (yes, they're still alive) to all the people who think quartz crystals cure herpes, from Ralph Nader to the entire country of Sweden, P. J. O'Rourke has created a roster of the most useless, politically disgraceful, and downright foolish people around. Although a rating system of S=Silly, VS=Very Silly, SML=Shirley MacLaine was ultimately cast aside, the distinguishing feature of the cluster of dunces presented here is silliness, not political subversion. The Enemies List began as an article in the American Spectator and, as readers contributed their own suggestions, quickly grew into a hilarious and slashing commentary on politicians and celebrities alike. Now they have been named, we just need to figure out what to do with them. ""To say that P. J. O'Rourke is funny is like saying that the Rocky Mountains are scenic - accurate but insufficient."" - Chicago Tribune"; Fiction , Humorous , General;Atlantic Monthly Press;5.29;March;1996

The Kindness of Sisters: Annabella Milbanke and the Destruction of the Byrons;By Crane, David;"An original account, revolutionary in technique, examining the character of the great Romantic poet Lord Byron through the lives and deadly rivalry of the two women he left behind.The heart of David Crane's account is the lifelong feud between Augusta - Byron's half sister with whom he had a passionate affair - and Annabella, his society wife, both of whom bore him daughters. Crane reimagines the famous meeting between the two women years after Byron's death, a chillingly dramatic scene through which he explores the emotional and sexual truths that lay at the center of these tragic relationships. In the encounter between the two women - one in chronic ill health, the other dying - we have the ultimate display of their mutual obsession with the memory and compulsive influence of Byron that makes their story that of the Romantic Age itself.It is a story full of dubious motives, especially Annabella's ""saving"" of Augusta and her child, Medora, and her twisted revenge on them both. And as the curses of incest and abuse play themselves out in the fates of Byron's daughters, we see their lives assuming the shape of Greek tragedy.In the meeting of the two women and the consequences of their battle, Crane shows us the Romantic Age in its terrible collision with the new world of the Victorians. The Kindness of Sisters establishes Crane as a biographer of formidable gifts."; Biography & Autobiography , Literary;Alfred A. Knopf;5.53;September;2002
Fuzzy Math: The Essential Guide to the Bush Tax Plan;By Bush, George W. and Krugman, Paul R.;Economist Paul Krugman analyzes the Bush and other tax proposals, showing who wins, who loses, and how quickly the tax cuts will consume the surplus. He argues that although the tax cut might not be a matter of economic life or death, it has become a central political issue that has a distorting effect on the debate on other issues and discourages crusaders from telling the truth about their own proposals. He also maintains that reporters and TV commentators don't understand the basics about the federal government and that they, together with politicians, have confused the public. Annotation c.

Shadow : Five Presidents and the Legacy of Watergate;By Woodward, Bob;A New York Times Notable Book of the YearTwenty-five years ago, after Richard Nixon resigned the presidency, Gerald Ford promised a return to normalcy. “My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over,” President Ford declared. But it was not. The Watergate scandal, and the remedies against future abuses of power, would have an enduring impact on presidents and the country. In Shadow, Bob Woodward takes us deep into the administrations of Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton to describe how each discovered that the presidency was forever altered. With special emphasis on the human toll, Woodward shows the consequences of the new ethics laws, and the emboldened Congress and media. Powerful investigations increasingly stripped away the privacy and protections once expected by the nation's chief executive. Shadow is an authoritative, unsettling narrative of the modern, beleaguered presidency.; History , World;Simon & Schuster;4.99;June;2000
Something Worth Doing: The Sub-Arctic Voyage of Aqua Star;By Chopra, Judith Wright;On May 18, 1985, pursued by a heavy spring rain, Leslie Sike's meticulously crafted steel cutter, Aqua Star, slipped out of Toronto's harbor on the first leg of the voyage to Churchill, Manitoba, on the western shore of the treacherous Hudson Bay. Sike, an adventurer with a yearning to make the record books, had discovered that since Hudson himself, only oceangoing tankers and fishing trawlers had plowed through the bay's wind-whipped and iceberg-studded expanses. He vowed to be the first to sail across the bay, and so began Aqua Star's sub-Arctic adventure.Sike and his wife, Carolann, whose sailing experiences went no further than dinghy lessons on Calgary's Glenmore Reservoir and correspondence courses on navigation, dedicated all of their energy and resources to making their unlikely dream come true. As Sike completed the building of the 41-foot steel yacht, Carolann set out to attract media attention and sponsorship. They found an eager crew in Gay Currie, an experienced sailor who signed on as cook, and David Farr, a nonsailor who undertook to photograph the voyage.For the outdoor enthusiast, Something Worth Doing is an exciting and unusually candid adventure story that records, in the sailors' own words, their exceptional journey, and captures, in vivid full-color photographs, the remote beauty of northern Canada.; Sports & Recreation , Boating;W W Norton & Co Inc;5.35;June;1995

Recasting Autobiography: Women's Counterfictions in Contemporary German Literature and Film (Reading Women Writing);By Kosta, Barbara;"""How did we become the way we are?"" The question that haunts Christa Wolf's autobiographical work Patterns of Childhood has prompted many other writers and filmmakers to examine their identities as postwar German women. In one of the first books to address the New German Cinema from a feminist perspective, Barbara Kosta looks closely at two autobiographical films; Helma Sanders-Brahms's Germany, Pale Mother and Jutta Bruckner's Years of Hunger, and at two books, Ruth Rehmann's Der Mann auf der Kanzel: Fragen an einen Vater (The man in the pulpit: Questions for a father,) and Wolf's Patterns of Childhood. In different ways, Kosta shows, these works of the 1970s and 1980s have recast traditional autobiography, offering fresh characters in new roles exploring innovative forms of expression, and confronting long-repressed themes such as the devaluation of the female voice and the horror of Germany's fascist past.Kosta perceives in autobiographies by German women a conflict between the need to accept their sociocultural heritage and the desire to uncover and respond to its destructive aspects. As they struggle to redefine relationships among family, history, and self, Wolf and Rehmann write of the psychic structures, that were shaped by a childhood under the Third Reich in their films, Sanders-Brahms and Bruckner, who grew up after the war, explore issues of gender relations as well as re-enacting German history. For all four, Kosta demonstrates, autobiography is at once a process of remembering and working through national and personal trauma, a task of mourning and healing, and an act of self-invention."; Literary Criticism , General;Cornell University Press;5.29;June;1994

Cop: A True Story;By Middleton, Michael L.;"What's it like to sit in the front seat of a patrol car, cruising darkened city streets, when the radio crackles to life and sends you down an alley to a ""robbery in progress,"" the outcome of which you can't possibly predict? What's it like to knock on a crack-house door, service revolver drawn, not knowing who - or what - is behind it? What's it like, heart pounding in your chest, to stare down the barrel of a gun pointed straight at you by a murderously high suspect?Cop shows you what it's like. It's the explosive story of Sergeant Michael Middleton, a now-retired veteran of the LAPD and survivor of what may be the most brutal urban war zone in the country. From handling the call to his first homicide as a rookie cop to making his last collar, Middleton's story is a nerve-shattering, eyewitness account of life on America's meanest streets. In his two decades on the force, he investigated more than 20,000 felony crimes, was at the scene of nearly 600 murders - including those of five officers killed in the line of duty - and made over 3,000 arrests.In Cop, Middleton writes urgently and knowingly of those years on the streets. It's a pulse-quickening - and often heartbreaking - insider's view of life as a foot soldier in America's war on crime. With the threat of violence never far away, Middleton and his fellow officers daily faced drug dealers, desperate addicts, thieves, gun-crazy gangs, rapists, and murderers. And in telling the riveting stories of these encounters, Middleton uses them to make larger points - which will often surprise and shock you - about good, evil, heroism, racism, and more.Gripping, poignant, and brutally honest, Cop is an unforgettable portrait of life as a police officer on urban America's mean and gritty streets."; True Crime , General;Contemporary Books;5.29;March;1994

Her father, Rand, is an artist - easygoing, dreamy, principled, and chronically jobless.

How their intense passion for each other plays out against the sumptuousness and decay of 1950s New Orleans is something to which no innocent should be privy.In Sheila Bosworth's mesmerizing first novel, the era, the place, the people, of Clay-Lee's childhood all form an air as real as our own pasts, alternately dim and indelible, where everyone bears some guilt, and all are almost innocent.; Fiction , General;LSU Press;5.29;April;1996

Athenais: The Life of Louis XIV's Mistress, the Real Queen of France;By Hilton, Lisa;"Athenais de Montespan reigned as official mistress to Louis XIV during the most glorious period of ""the splendid century."" As lovely and charming as she was witty and cunning, Athenais quickly rose to far greater prominence than the King's own spouse. It was Madame de Montespan who was known as ""the real Queen of France,"" the symbol of the apotheosis of French culture in the seventeenth century. As a lover, she risked the disgrace of adultery to conduct an affair that scandalized Europe; as a patron, she supported many of the leaders of the cultural renaissance; as a mother, she is the ancestor of most of the royal houses of Europe.In her superb new biography, Lisa Hilton chronicles the life of this extraordinary woman. She vividly describes Athenais's unhappy marriage to a gamester nobleman, her entry into the decadent and intricate world of court politics, and her brilliant seduction of France's most desired suitor, the King himself. Athenais transformed Louis from a shy, awkward young monarch into the polished Sun King of legend.Throughout the ""age Montespan,"" Athenais used her wit and beauty to stave off the intrigues of courtiers, the machinations of Versaille's clerics, and the wiles of lovely young pretenders to the King's heart - all doggedly seeking to unseat her. It was not until the Affair of the Poisons, a bizarre witch-hunt that uncovered conspiracy in the highest echelons of the nobility, that Athenais's hold on the King and court faltered. Though the mystery remains unsolved, Athenais's implication in the sinister dealings of sorcerers and poisoners caused a fall from grace almost as precipitous as her rise."; Biography & Autobiography , Women;Little, Brown and Company;5.41;December;2002

Hamlet (Cambridge School Shakespeare);By Shakespeare, William, Gibson, Rex (EDT), and Andrews, Richard (EDT);This new edition of one of Shakespeare's most popular plays takes into account the work of the Shakespeare and Schools Project, the national curriculum for English, developments at GCSE and A-level, and the probable development of English and Drama throughout the 1990s. Cambridge School Shakespeare considers Hamlet as theatre and its text as script, enabling students to inhabit the imaginative world of the play in an accessible, meaningful and creative way. It approaches the play in a new way, encouraging students to participate actively in examining it, to work in groups as well as individually, to treat the play as a script to be re-created, and to explore the theatrical/dramatic qualities of the text.

Moreover, contributors insist that policymakers and care  providers look at African American family life and child development  from a culturally-based Africentric perspective. Such a perspective, the  book argues, can serve as a catalyst for creativity and innovation in  the formulation of policies and practices aimed at improving the welfare  of African American children.; Social Science , Children's Studies;Rutgers University Press;5.42;December;1991

Dear Kilroy: A Dog to Guide Us (Capital Ideas);By Harrison, Nora Vitz;"Kilroy, a yellow Labrador retriever, started life as a potential guide for the blind. His life took a detour when he was dropped from the program. Nora’s sister, Alice, adopted him as a pet. The love he brought to her life eased her through a very difficult time - the dissolution of her 18-year marriage. Watching and participating in this special relationship reminded Nora that success takes many forms. Kilroy ""failed"" as a guide dog, but he succeeded in changing Alice’s life for the better. He became her guide as she made her journey from grief to new happiness.     Some of the best teachers in this world have four legs and bark.

Managing from the Heart;By Bracey, Hyler, Rosenblum, Jack, Sanford, Aubrey, and Trueblood, Roy;From the brain trust at The Atlanta Consulting Group comes a simple method hailed as a revolution in management practice: learning to care.   Caring isn’t a frill. It delivers results. And for some unenlightened managers, learning to care can be a matter of corporate life or death. Managing from the Heart is the story of Harry Hartwell, a composite character drawn from decades of the authors’ field experience on the front lines of management reform. Known by his staffers as “the Abominable No Man,” Harry’s remarkable transformation into a caring and compassionate manage offers an easy-to-apply business parable—and an absolutely painless, one-of-a-kind learning experience. Acquire the five principles of caring management. Your people will be glad you did. And so will everyone who keeps an eye on your bottom line.   Praise for Managing from the Heart   “Outstanding! Delivers the right message at a critical time.”—Lee A. Robbins, VP and CFO, Puritan Bennett   “Five powerful principles, so simple they are arresting. Their application by every manager can catapult a company to new heights of greatness.”—Don M. Schrello, chairman, Schrello Direct Marketing, Inc.   “Much needed!”—Norman Vincent Peale   “Managing from the Heart is a gift you should give to yourself and your people.

Women's Growth In Connection: Writings from the Stone Center;By Miller, Jean Baker, Jordan, Judith V., Kaplan, Alexandra G., Stiver, Irene P., and Surrey, Janet L.;Overly emotional, hysterical, dependent, frivolous, fickle... Why have women been so consistently defined as deficient in maturity, self-mastery, and independence according to the models of human development inspired by male culture? The authors of WOMEN'S GROWTH IN CONNECTION, a sampling of the influential working papers from the Stone Center, Wellesley College, have sought to answer this question by studying developmental theory and reformulating it to reflect women's experience more accurately. These papers, about women's ways of being in the world, frame an innovative relational perspective on women's psychological development. The authors--clinicians, clinical supervisors, and teachers--have been searching for therapeutic models that take into account women's meaning systems, values, and organization of experiences, all of which often revolves around relationships rather than the self. By offering a new perspective on women's development, WOMEN'S GROWTH IN CONNECTION stands at the forefront of the ongoing feminist movement to examine and reshape psychological theory and practice. The authors offer this volume as an invitation to the reader to join in the building of new models of women's development.; Social Science , Women's Studies;The Guilford Press;5.29;April;1991
The Hungry Years: America in an Age of Crisis, 1929-1939;By Watkins, T. H.;The acclaimed author of Righteous Pilgrim delivers this dramatic account of the Great Depression as seen by those who lived through it. Less concerned with the power brokers in Washington than with the daily struggles of ordinary people at the grass roots, The Hungry Years draws on little-known oral histories, memoirs, local press, and scholarly monographs to capture the voices of Americans in a time of unprecedented crisis. The result is narrative history at its best: a comprehensive single volume that traces the stages of the disaster chronologically without losing touch with the wounds it inflicted or the ways people responded. Humane and compassionate, historically sound, full of story and anecdote, The Hungry Years puts the reader at the very heart of the maelstrom that was the American Depression.; History , United States , General;Henry Holt and Co.;5.13;October;1999
The Runaway Brain: The Evolution Of Human Uniqueness;By Wills, Christopher;"The human brain is astonishingly different from the brain of any other animal. Why? Have we somehow fooled Mother Nature and escaped from the laws of evolution?Written like a detective story, this book brings together a wealth of new research from paleontology, genetics, and neurobiology to explain the runaway evolution of the human brain. Evolutionists and human paleontologists have tended to assume that our intellect began to burgeon when our ancestors developed the ability to walk upright, to grasp and carry objects, or to form cooperative groups for hunting. While these and many other factors are important, this book shows that they are only some of the latest steps in a long evolutionary story that began a billion years ago. By now, the brains of many different animals are much larger than those of their predecessors and are superbly adapted to environments that have slowly become more complex. But our own distant ancestors were the only ones to enter a new evolutionary path, a feedback loop that involved their brains, their bodies, and an ever more complicated environment that they largely created themselves. The result, for better and sometimes for worse, is our own astonishing species.The author shows how this view of our evolution as a runaway process casts light on a number of major questions that recent discoveries have raised about our past. These include the identity and true role of the mitochondrial Eve, the origin of human diversity, and the confusion and controversy surrounding our fossil record. Two major views of recent human evolution hinge on the time at which people like ourselves first arose. Did they do so in several different parts of the Old World, the so-called ""multiple origins"" model, or did they appear suddenly and recently, perhaps driving all the more primitive hominids to extinction? The first model is favored by many anthropologists; the second, by many geneticists. While it is not yet possible to decide with certainty between the two, the book details how the driving force of runaway brain evolution is so great that it can easily account for multiple origins.Turning to the evolution of the brain itself, the author recounts the escape of our ancestors from the ""stupidworlds"" of the past. He shows how, as a result of this escape, our brains have evolved into sponges for knowledge. They are so versatile, and have been driven by such strong evolutionary pressures, that fundamental human capabilities such as language can be traced to many different parts of the brain that have simultaneously increased in complexity. Using a vivid series of examples, the book details scientists' growing knowledge of the kinds of genetic changes that have powered the runaway process.Written by a scientist whose previous books have explored the whole sweep of evolution and the complexities of the human genome, The Runaway Brain casts a brilliant light on human intellect and human nature."; Science , General;Basic Books;5.29;October;1993

The Irony Of Virtue: Ethics And American Power;By Lefever, Ernest W.;This definitive anthology is the fruit of one of America’s most respected neoconservatives. Trained in Christian ethics, Ernest Lefever has been an articulate public policy advocate. Both conservatives and liberals will ignore his views at their peril.In this first-ever anthology of his most important work, Lefever takes a bold and lively march through the second half of the twentieth century. As an acute participant-observer who cares deeply about peace, freedom, and human dignity, Lefever became a neoconservative twenty years before Irving Kristol coined the term. For this volume, Lefever selected forty of his most influential essays from some 500 published pieces. They reveal his dramatic transformation from a liberal pacifist during World War II to a humane realist.The earliest essays, from Lefever’s Yale Divinity School days, recount his experience as a civil rights activist during World War II and as a relief worker in the POW camps of postwar Europe. Later essays assess such institutions as the United Nations and the World Council of Churches. Lefever tackles a myriad policy issues from nuclear testing and human rights to arms control and the collapse of communism. His essays on the Berlin Wall and his reappraisal of the Vietnam legacy confirm his skill at combining history, political theory, and opinion journalism. An introductory autobiographical sketch vividly portrays Lefever’s spiritual and political pilgrimage.; Philosophy , Ethics & Moral Philosophy;Basic Books;5.29;December;1997

In Our Own Best Interest: How Defending Human Rights Benefits Us All;By Schulz, William F. and Robinson, Mary (FRW);"From the director of Amnesty International, a provocative new argument for defending human rights The Philippines, Haiti, Rwanda, Bosnia, east Los Angeles. The nightly news brings vivid images of the mistreatment of people all over the world into our living rooms. In the secure comfort of those rooms, we may feel sympathetic, but far removed from these atrocities. ""What does all this have to do with a person in east Tennessee?"" is the question, from a call-in radio program listener, that prompted Bill Schulz to write this book. Schulz provides answers with an insightful work, generously laced with compelling stories of women and men from all continents, which clearly delineates the connection between Americans' prosperity and human rights violations all over the globe. The book reveals the high cost to the U.S. military of acute political instability in Eastern Europe, the economic impact on U.S. businesses of systemic corruption in East Asia, the serious worldwide environmental hazards of nuclear fuel leaks in Russia, the imminent threat of deadly viruses spreading from Africa, and even the expensive consequences of substandard prison conditions in the United States, to name some examples. At the heart of each of these problems lies the abuse of basic human rights. Through these stories, Schulz builds a powerful case for defending our own interests by vigorously defending the human rights of people everywhere.""If any foreign policy primer could be called a page-turner, it is this one by the executive director of Amnesty International USA. What the human rights community needs to do, argues Schulz in this well-written clarion call, is find 'the compelling reasons why respect for human rights is in the best interests of the United States.' . . . Schulz has written a clear and provocative book that should be read by all concerned with human rights and U.S. foreign policy and will draw new supporters among the general public."" —Publishers Weekly, Starred Review ""In such a climate, William F. Schulz, a former UUA president and current executive director of Amnesty International USA, has written a smart, detailed and compelling book about the urgency of the human rights movement. In Our Own Best Interest: How Defending Human Rights Benefits All Americans strikes at the core of existing notions of national self-interest by making the case that if we value our own lives and futures, we will pay serious attention to upholding human rights everywhere on earth. . . . In writing In Our Own Best Interests, Schulz has given new life and strength to the reality of our interdependence."" —World"; Philosophy , Methodology;Beacon Pr;5.29;April;2001
No Neutral Ground?: Abortion Politics In An Age Of Absolutes (Dilemmas in American Politics);By O'Connor, Karen;In a single year, Dr. David Gunn was killed, Jane Roe recanted, the Supreme Court began to backpedal from its landmark 1973 decision, Congress became fixated on a rare late-term abortion procedure, and numerous states imposed legislation limiting a woman’s right to choose. It was a year of extremes for an issue that seems to know no middle ground, and it is the polarizing quality of abortion as a policymaking dilemma that No Neutral Ground? seeks to address.One of the most heated and often violent issues of our time, abortion continues to challenge leaders, citizens, and policymakers alike. Is it a question of morality? Personal liberty? The right to privacy? Keeping the peace? What are the implications of the Supreme Court’s rulings on abortion for future legislation? And what does it mean for every level of government when an issue defies consensus the way that abortion does?In her unique treatment of this complex subject, Karen O’Connor builds on the history of abortion as a political issue—how it was first defined in the early 1800s and how it got on the political agenda—and takes us through the tug-of-war development of abortion politics to the present, using the policy process framework. Examining key court cases, institutions, dramatic events, and opinions from the public to the Supreme Court, O’Connor highlights the dilemma of how a polity attempts to make decisions about issues on which agreement or compromise is unlikely. She questions whether such divisive issues can ever be satisfactorily resolved, but gives us the tools to explore every avenue toward potential resolution.; Political Science , American Government , National;Westview Press;5.29;August;1996
Neighboring on the Air: Cooking With the KMA Radio Homemakers (Shenandoah, Iowa);By Birkby, Evelyn;"In 1925 Earl May began broadcasting KMA Radio-960 from Shenandoah,  Iowa, to boost his fledgling seed business. The station aired practical  information designed to help with the day-to-day activity in midwestern  farmhouse kitchens. Before long KMA was a trusted friend throughout the  wide listening area, offering inspiration, companionship, and all  manners of domestic counsel. Hosting the daily radio programs—Home Hour,  the Stitch and Chat Club, and the KMA Party Line—and the live cooking  demonstrations that drew thousands to the KMA auditorium was a changing  roster of personable, lively women who quickly became known as the KMA  Radio Homemakers.Now, in Neighboring on the Air, we can hear the voices  of the KMA homemakers and sample their philosophy and—best of  all—cooking. Through recipes, biographies, and household advice we get  to know such enduring women as ""The Little Minister,"" the Reverend  Edythe Stirlen, and Leanna Driftmier and the whole Kitchen-Klatter  family, part of the longest-running homemaker program in the history of  radio. Learn how to make Sour Cream Apple Pie from ""The Farmer's Wife,""  Florence Falk; Varnished Chicken from the first long-term KMA Radio  Homemaker, Jessie Young; and E.E.E. Missouri Dessert (nobody can  remember what the ""E.E.E."" stands for) from the indomitable host of the  Edith Hansen Kitchen Club. This endearing scrapbook of people, places,  and foods charts the continuing adventure of the KMA homemakers as they  broadcast into the 1990s. Neighboring on the Air is an  enchanting piece of Americana. Anyone interested in cooking, cultural  history, or the Midwest will want to own and use this book."; Cooking , Reference;University of Iowa Press;10.99;June;1991
Movie Anecdotes;By Hay, Peter;"Hollywood, Walter Winchell quipped, is where they shoot too many movies and not enough actors. Always looking for an angle, always, scheming, always the scene of clashing egos, the movie industry is where they place you under contract instead of observation--and if you don't have anything nice to say, write it down. ""In 1940, I had my choice between Hitler and Hollywood,"" French director René Clair recalled, ""and I preferred Hollywood--just a little.""In Movie Anecdotes, Peter Hay treats us to a delightful ride through the world that has captivated audiences for almost a century, with stories that are often hilarious, sometimes tragic, and always entertaining. He takes us from the rough-and tumble early days (when one studio paid Pancho Villa $25,000 to launch his attacks only in daylight, after a film crew had set up) to the studio era (when Joan Crawford refused to cross the street on the MGM lot except in a chauffeured limousine) to the shenanigans of today's global industry. Here are stories about all the legends: Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, Mae West, Lucille Ball, Marilyn Monroe, Errol Flynn, Humphrey Bogart, Bette Davis, Judy Garland, Sophia Loren, John Wayne, and, of course, Ronald Reagan. There are the great directors from D.W. Griffith, Hitchcock, and Eisenstein, to Kurosawa, Bergman, Visconti, Huston, Ford, and Woody Allen. And Hay has selected tales of the writers, the wits, and the grand moguls, including perhaps the largest collection of Goldwynisms--both genuine and apocryphal.Along with the laughter, this volume recreates the conflicts that have torn the movie world, from battles over money and contracts, to discrimination, divorces, and scandals. Colorful, incredible, bitter, funny--the stories about moviemaking are as fantastic as the pictures themselves. Now they have been gathered together in an irresistible bouquet that is certain to delight every movie buff and provide fascinating insights for serious students of film."; History , Europe , Great Britain;Oxford University Press;4.99;November;1990

Suspicion of Madness;By Parker, Barbara;"For nearly a decade Barbara Parker's phenomenally successful thrillers have delighted readers and reviewers alike. The Chicago Tribune applauds her ""taut storytelling...tight plotting and lively characterization."" The Miami Herald hails her for her ""well-paced, compelling stories and believable characters with emotional depth and texture that should turn casual readers into fanatics."" And the San Antonio Express-News calls her novels simply ""enthralling."" Now this supremely gifted author returns with a blockbuster story of smoldering suspense that pits Gail and Anthony against their most chilling adversary yet.  For attorneys Gail Connor and Anthony Quintana, spending a couple of days in a private villa on a secluded island in the Florida Keys seems almost too good to be true. The innocent cliché hits home with a vengeance when a dangerously unbalanced former client of Anthony's is suspected of a local murder, and then attempts suicide. As an idyllic vacation turns into an escalating nightmare of terror and death, Gail and Anthony find themselves isolated among the strange and secretive islanders as a late tropical storm threatens to unleash its fury on them all.

If I Never Get Back;By Brock, Darryl;Contemporary reporter Sam Fowler, stuck in a dull job and a failing marriage, abruptly finds himself transported back to the summer of 1869. After a wrenching period of adjustment, he comes to feel rejuvenated by his involvement with the nation's first pro baseball players. He also finds his senses quickening and tastes changing as he faces life-threatening 19th-century challenges on and off the baseball diamond. Through his attachments to the ballplayers and the lovely Caitlin O'Neill, he might just regain the sense of family he desperately needs. Darryl Brock masterfully evokes post-Civil War America’s smoky, turbulent cities, the new transcontinental railroad that takes passengers over prairies and mountains to California, the dance halls and parlor houses, the financial booms and busts, and historical luminaries like Mark Twain and Jesse James. Equally appealing to sports fans and anyone who likes a good read, If I Never Get Back well deserves the Cleveland Plain Dealer’s judgment that it “hits a home run.”; Fiction , Sports;Crown;10.99;December;1989
X Windows System Administrator's Guide, Vol 8 (Definitive Guides to the X Window System);By Mui, Linda, Pearce, Eric, and O'Reilly, Tim (EDT);"As X moves out of the hacker's domain and into the ""real world,"" users can't be expected to master all the ins and outs of setting up and administering their own X software. That will increasingly become the domain of system administrators. Even for experienced system administrators, X raises many issues, both because of subtle changes in the standard UNIX way of doing things and because X blurs the boundaries between different platforms. Under X, users can run applications across the network on systems with different resources (including fonts, colors, and screen size). Many of these issues are poorly understood, and the technology for dealing with them is in rapid flux.This book is the first and only book devoted to the issues of system administration for X and X-based networks, written not just for UNIX system administrators but for anyone faced with the job of administering X (including those running X on stand-alone workstations). The book includes:An overview of X that focuses on issues that affect the system administrator's job.Information on obtaining, compiling, and installing the X software, including a discussion of the trade-offs between vendor-supplied and the free MIT versions of X.How to set up xdm, the X display manager, which takes the place of the login program under X and can be used to create a customized turnkey X session for each user.How to set up user accounts under X (includes a comparison of the familiar shell setup files and programs to the new mechanisms provided by X).Issues involved in making X more secure. X's security features are not strong, but an understanding of what features are available can be very important, since X makes it possible for users to intrude on each other in new and sometimes unexpected ways.How fonts are used by X, including a description of the font server.A discussion of the issues raised by running X on heterogenous networks.How colors are managed under X and how to get the same colors across multiple devices with different hardware characteristics.The administration issues involved in setting up and managing an X terminal.How to use PC and Mac X servers to maximize reuse of existing hardware and convert outdated hardware into X terminals.How to obtain and install additional public domain software and patches for X.Covers features new in R5, including the font server and Xcms."; Computers , Programming Languages , General;O'Reilly Media;5.7;October;1992

Messages from an Owl (Princeton Legacy Library, 326);By Terman, Max R.;"When zoologist Max Terman came to the rescue of a great horned owlet in a Kansas town park, he embarked on an adventure that would test his scientific ingenuity and lead to unprecedented observations of an owl's hidden life in the wild. In Messages from an Owl, Terman not only relates his experiences nursing the starving owlet, ""Stripey,"" back to health and teaching it survival skills in his barn, but also describes the anxiety and elation of letting a companion loose into an uncertain world. Once Terman felt that Stripey knew how to dive after prey, he set the owl free. At this point his story could have ended, with no clue as to what the young bird's fate would be--had it not been for Terman's experimentation with radio tags. By strapping the tags to Stripey, he actually managed to follow the owl into the wild and observe for himself the behavior of a hand-reared individual reunited with its natural environment.Through this unique use of telemetry, Terman tracked Stripey for over six years after the bird left the scientist's barn and took up residence in the surrounding countryside on the Kansas prairie. The radio beacon provided Terman with information on the owl's regular patterns of playing, hunting, exploring, and protecting. It enabled him to witness the moments when Stripey was bantered and mobbed by crows, when other owls launched fierce attacks, and when a prospective mate caught Stripey's eye. On occasional returns to the barn, the owl would follow Terman around as he performed chores, usually waiting for a handout.Until now, scientists have generally believed that an owl nurtured by humans becomes ill-adapted for meeting the challenges of life in the wild. Terman's research proves otherwise. Stripey surpassed all expectations by becoming a totally independent wild creature. With Terman, however, Stripey remained tame, allowing the author to explore something one rarely sees in owls: a warm interest in humanity. Terman engagingly re-creates this dimension of Stripey as he describes with humor and compassion the daily challenges of probing the life of a ""phantom winged tiger.""Originally published in 1996.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

Imagining Argentina;By Thornton, Lawrence;"“Remarkable . . . deeply  inventive . . . Thorton has imagined Argentina truly; his  inspired fable troubles and feeds our own intriguing imagining.”—Los Angeles TimesImagining Argentina is set in the  dark days of the late 1970's, when thousands of    Argentineans disappeared without a trace into the  general's prison cells and torture   chambers. When  Carlos Ruweda's wife is suddenly taken from him, he  discovers a   magical gift: In waking dreams, he had  clear visions of the fates of “the  disappeared.” But he cannot “imagine” what  has happened to his own wife. Driven to near  madness,   his mind cannot be taken away: imagination, stories, and  the mystical secrets of   the human  spirit.Praise for Imagining Argentina“A harrowing, brilliant  novel.”—The New Yorker“A  powerful new novel . . . Thorton seems to have wedded  his study of such writers as Borges and Marquez with thy his own instinctive gift for metaphor, and  in doing so, created his own brand of magical realism”—The New York Times“Imagining Argentina is a slim volume filled with beautiful writing. It is an exciting adventure story. It is a haunting love story. And it is a story for all  time.”—Detroit Free Press“The writing is crystalline, the  metaphors compelling . . . Its central theme is universal.”—The Philadelphia Inquirer“In a time when much North American fiction is contained by crabbed realism, Thorton takes for his material one of the bleaker recent instances of human cruelty, sees in it the enduring nobility of the human spirit and imagines a book that celebrates that spirit.”—The Washington Post Book World “A powerful first  novel and a manifesto for the memorializing power of literature.”—The New York Times Book Review“A  profoundly hopeful book.”—The Cleveland Plain Dealer"; Fiction , Short Stories (single author);Bantam;4.99;November;1991

New content, exciting Jabez-inspired stories, and enriched commentary from Dr. Wilkinson make this a must-have for anyone who wants to live a world-changing life for God.Go Deeper.  Farther.  BEYOND.  When people passionately pray, God doesn’t just listen. He responds!  Where the #1 New York Times bestseller The Prayer of Jabez left off, Beyond Jabez picks up and goes even deeper. Priceless testimonies of answered prayer and bold, biblical teaching clear up the misconceptions surrounding this once little-known prayer. Is it really right to ask God to bless me? How can I experience the miracles accompanying a Jabez lifestyle? The answers inside will destroy doubt and sound the trumpet blast announcing a glorious new chapter in your walk with the Lord!  Are you ready? Because God is still moving—and asking you to do the same!  Inside Left Flap  Dare to Go There.  True Stories  When The Prayer of Jabez sold nine million copies in two years, Bruce Wilkinson’s mailbox was flooded with countless personal stories of answered prayer. God’s mighty hand was using the prayer to change lives in both small and dramatic ways. Such undeniable testimonies make it impossible to ignore God’s presence, active and alive today!  Refreshing Clarity  Beyond Jabez examines the larger biblical context of the once little-known prayer found in 1 Chronicles 4:9–10. Wilkinson’s sound instruction answers the skepticism surrounding the Jabez phenomenon and returns an awesome sense of wonder to the miracle of prayer.  Deeper Application  Packed with practical guidance from a man who daily prays Jabez’s prayer—and has for more than thirty years!— Beyond Jabez reveals how, with a sincere heart and a devoted prayer life, God can use you mightily for His purposes!  Story Behind the BookBruce Wilkinson spent thirty years studying and praying the prayer of Jabez. The original manuscript was over three hundred pages long. When The Prayer of Jabez was released in the spring of 2000, it had been culled down to 96 pages. It was originally intended as a gift from Bruce to the attendees of the 2000 National Day of Prayer. Now in 2005, the fifth anniversary of the release of the original Prayer of Jabez, the release of Beyond Jabez will be more like the book Bruce Wilkinson originally intended to write—a book with more teaching, stories of God’s blessings, and more application of what God intended of us in petitioning Him.; Religion , Christian Living , General;Multnomah;4.99;January;2005

Closing the Gap: A Strategy for Bringing Parents and Teens Together;By McGraw, Jay;Parents: Does your teen withdraw to his or her room at every opportunity? Does she talk with you about her friends? Does he participate in discussions at meals? Does your teen want you to see projects from school? When is the last time you actually went into your teen's room and looked at what's hanging on the walls and sitting on the shelves?  Teens: Do your parents hide behind the newspaper? Do they always have to work when you've got a game, a recital, or an open house at school? Is there anything you do together anymore? When was the last time they took a walk, a bike ride, or even a trip to get ice cream with you?  When did that sudden gap divide your home into territories staked and claimed, with music blasting through the halls and fists banging on doors to turn down the stereo/TV/video game? Teens, when did you start seeing your parents as your enemies instead of your heroes? And parents, when did you start seeing your teens as crazy little demons instead of your loving children?  Finally, there is a solution for both sides, and one that will not only bridge that gap but show parents and teens alike how to prevent it. Jay McGraw is the ideal person to write a book for both parents and teens. A bestselling author by the age of twenty-one and son of number one New York Times bestseller Phillip C. McGraw, Ph.D., known to millions worldwide as Dr. Phil, Jay has seen the parent-teen battle from all angles. In this groundbreaking work, he introduces a new plan for both teens and their parents to work through the issues that divide them and, in the process, rediscover the love that initially defined their relationship.  Jay works from both sides -- sharing the perspectives of parent and teen as the former struggles for control, the latter for independence. He explains to parents how their teenagers wish to be treated, cared for, and even disciplined, and he shows teens how gaining power can come only from earning respect. In this entertaining, informative, and life-changing book, Jay gives instructions to both sides of the familial gap on:  Dos and Don'ts for Parents and Teens Parent and Teen Myths Discovering Your Needs Tuning In to the Needs of Others Ten Ways to Bridge the Gap and Reconnect   In finding a common ground and, even more important, a common respect for each other, parents and teens can break down the walls, unlock the doors, and welcome each other back into one another's lives again.; Family & Relationships , Parenting , General;Touchstone;4.99;November;2001

Eisenhower  The Kennedy White House is the first truly intimate look at Kennedy family life inside the White House. It is an unprecedented visit behind the scenes, revealing the world's most famous family in the world's most famous house. Author Carl Sferrazza Anthony scoured the Kennedy Library archives for never-before-seen color and black-and-white photographs that succeed in illustrating the Kennedy family story -- the joys and tragedies, celebrations and anniversaries, informal family gatherings and escapes to their private homes in Virginia, Palm Beach, Newport, and Hyannis Port. The book also explores for the first time the relationships between Jack and Jackie's nuclear family and both of their extended families.  The 337 full-color and black-and-white photos, taken by the primary White House photographers, are unstaged and provide a far more natural, spontaneous, and realistic portrait of the family than ever before; most of them, including color photographs of each of the private rooms, have never been seen, and they present an unparalleled look at life as it was lived behind the White House doors.  This is also the first book to place the Kennedy family within the context of the culture of the early 1960s and tell the story of the president's personal maturity through his evolving family relationships. Historical events like the Cuban Missile Crisis are uniquely viewed from the family's perspective. An appealing combination of history, biography, and popular culture, The Kennedy White House sheds new light on a family that continues to fascinate the American public forty years after they first captivated our attention."; History , United States , General;Touchstone;8.79;September;2001

An Obsession With Butterflies: Our Long Love Affair With A Singular Insect;By Russell, Sharman Apt;"Sharman Apt Russell again blends her lush voice and keen scientific eye in this marvelous book about butterflies. From Hindu mythology to Aztec sacrifices, butterflies have served as a metaphor for resurrection and transformation. Even during World War II, children in a Polish death camp scratched hundreds of butterflies onto the walls of their barracks. But as Russell points out in this rich and lyrical meditation, butterflies are above all objects of obsession. From the beastly horned caterpillar, whose blood helps it count time, to the peacock butterfly, with wings that hiss like a snake, Russell traces the butterflies through their life cycles, exploring the creatures' own obsessions with eating, mating, and migrating. In this way, she reveals the logic behind our endless fascination with butterflies as well as the driving passion of such legendary collectors as the tragic Eleanor Glanville, whose children declared her mad because of her compulsive butterfly collecting, and the brilliant Henry Walter Bates, whose collections from the Amazon in 1858 helped develop his theory of mimicry in nature. Russell also takes us inside some of the world's most prestigious natural history museums, where scientists painstakingly catalogue and categorize new species of Lepidoptera, hoping to shed light on insect genetics and evolution. A luminous journey through an exotic world of obsession and strange beauty, this is a book to be treasured by anyone who's ever watched a butterfly mid-flight and thought, as Russell has, ""I've entered another dimension."""; Nature , Animals , Butterflies & Moths;Basic Books;4.99;May;2003
A Samba for Sherlock;By Soares, Jo and Landers, Clifford E. (TRN);"Set in Rio de Janeiro in 1886, this internationally acclaimed literary thriller begins with the theft of a Stradivarius violin that has been presented by His Majesty the Emperor of Brazil to one of his more delectable mistresses--a harmless crime in itself but one that mystifies the authorities and (far more important) embarrasses the Emperor.  At the suggestion of Sarah Bernhardt, who is on a triumphant tour through South America, the great Sherlock Holmes is summoned from London to solve the case. But by the time he arrives, events have taken a turn for the worse, as a series of grisly murders shocks the city--the victims all beautiful young women. In each case, the killer leaves his calling card: a violin string entangled in the woman's pubic hair, the corpse stripped of a flap of skin.Holmes (and Dr. Watson, of course) are immediately off on the track of the killer, but although Sherlock succeeds in coining the term ""serial killer,""  his celebrated powers of deduction don't get him very far with the case itself: overcome by the charm of the tropics, some spectacular digestive difficulties, and the strong appeal of a pretty young actress--at thirty-two, he's not exactly a sexual virtuoso--Sherlock finds himself in a thicker fog than he ever encountered back home in London. And in dark counterpoint to Holmes's questionable ratiocinations and the novel's brilliantly re-created texture of nineteenth-century literary, social, and low-life Rio, is the chilling yet hypnotic voice of the killer himself, a monster of intelligence, evil, and ever-spreading fame. . . .A Samba for Sherlock is the work of a mind of encyclopedic knowledge, caustic wit, brilliant style, and, above all, a formidable ability to entertain."; Fiction , Mystery & Detective , General;Pantheon;5.29;October;1997
If the Gods Had Meant Us to Vote They Would Have Given Us Candidates;By Hightower, Jim;"If anything, in this presidential election special, he's madder than ever!In his earlier bestseller, There's Nothing in the Middle of the Road but Yellow Stripes and Dead Armadillos, Hightower only began to tap into the deep yearning that Americans have for a new politics that speaks to them from a real-world, kitchen-table perspective. Now, with the year 2000 being an especially significant marker for contemplating our country's direction, not only for the new year but for the new century and the new millennium, it's time for citizens to reclaim their political, economic, and cultural heritage.Leading the way with his hilariously irreverent yet profoundly serious book is our name-naming, podium-pounding, point-them-in-the-right-direction populist, Hightower himself. He whacks conventional wisdom right upside the head,showing,with startling facts and compelling personal stories, that despite a so-called period of prosperity, America's middle class is getting mugged, and that far from being ordained by the gods,globalization is globaloney! Hightower rips the mass off of the candidates, the parties, the consultants, and especially the moneyed powers whoa re supporting all of the leading presidential hopefuls. he's mad about them all--but what he's maddest about, what really gets his goat,is that they are all the same! To paraphrase Jim, American politicians are alike because they don't come cheap. In fact, they're all very expansive. which is why only the rich can own them and why their allegiance is definitely not to regular,worka-day citizens.No one is spared in this insightful and engaging blend of horror and success stories, hard-hitting commentary, laugh-out-loud humor, useful facts, and sparkling language. An equal opportunity muckraker and conscientious agitator for ""We the people,"" Hightower inspires us to take charge again, to build a new politics, and, together, to build a better tomorrow. Jim Hightower's If the Gods Had Meant Us to Vote They Would Have Given Us Candidates proves yet again that his is a uniquely wise and peerlessly singular voice in the maelstrom of political prattle."; Humor , Topic , Politics;Harper;10.99;March;2000

Lesbian Mothers: Accounts of Gender in American Culture (The Anthropology of Contemporary Issues);By Lewin, Ellen;"Within a society that long considered ""lesbian motherhood"" a contradiction in terms, what were the experiences of lesbian mothers at the end of the twentieth century? In this illuminating book, lesbian mothers tell their stories of how they became mothers; how they see their relationships with their children, relatives, lovers, and friends and with their children’s fathers and sperm donors; how they manage child-care arrangements and financial difficulties; and how they deal with threats to custody. Ellen Lewin’s unprecedented research on lesbian mothers in the San Francisco area captured a vivid portrait of the moment before gay and lesbian parenting moved into the mainstream of U.S. culture.

Sunlight At Midnight St. Petersburg And The Rise Of Modern Russia;By Lincoln, W. Bruce;"For Russians, St. Petersburg has embodied power, heroism, and fortitude. It has encompassed all the things that the Russians are and that they hope to become. Opulence and artistic brilliance blended with images of suffering on a monumental scale make up the historic persona of the late W. Bruce Lincoln's lavish ""biography"" of this mysterious, complex city. Climate and comfort were not what Tsar Peter the Great had in mind when, in the spring of 1703, he decided to build a new capital in the muddy marshes of the Neva River delta. Located 500 miles below the Arctic Circle, this area, with its foul weather, bad water, and sodden soil, was so unattractive that only a handful of Finnish fisherman had ever settled there. Bathed in sunlight at midnight in the summer, it brooded in darkness at noon in the winter, and its canals froze solid at least five months out of every year. Yet to the Tsar, the place he named Sankt Pieter Burkh had the makings of a ""paradise."" His vision was soon borne out: though St. Petersburg was closer to London, Paris, and Vienna than to Russia's far-off eastern lands, it quickly became the political, cultural, and economic center of an empire that stretched across more than a dozen time zones and over three continents. In this book, revolutionaries and laborers brush shoulders with tsars, and builders, soldiers, and statesmen share pride of place with poets. For only the entire historical experience of this magnificent and mysterious city can reveal the wealth of human and natural forces that shaped the modern history of it and the nation it represents."; History , Russia & the Former Soviet Union;Basic Books;4.99;May;2001

A People Adrift : The Crisis of the Roman Catholic Church in America;By Steinfels, Peter;"In A People Adrift, a prominent Catholic thinker states bluntly that the Catholic Church in the United States must transform itself or suffer irreversible decline. Peter Steinfels shows how even before the recent revelations about sexual abuse by priests, the explosive combination of generational change and the thinning ranks of priests and nuns was creating a grave crisis of leadership and identity.    This groundbreaking book offers an analysis not just of the church's immediate troubles but of less visible, more powerful forces working below the surface of an institution that provides a spiritual identity for 65 million Americans and spans the nation with its parishes, schools, colleges and universities, hospitals, clinics, and social service agencies.  In A People Adrift, Steinfels warns that entrenched liberals and conservatives are trapped in a ""theo-logical gridlock"" that often ignores what in fact goes on in families, parishes, classrooms, voting booths, and Catholic organizations of all types. Above all, he insists, the altered Catholic landscape demands a new agenda for leadership, from the selection of bishops and the rethinking of the priesthood to the thorough preparation and genuine incorporation of a lay leadership that is already taking over key responsibilities in Catholic institutions.     Catholicism exerts an enormous cultural and political presence in American life. No one interested in the nation's moral, intellectual, and political future can be indifferent to the fate of what has been one of the world's most vigorous churches -- a church now severely challenged."; Religion , Christianity , Catholic;Simon & Schuster;5.41;August;2003

Eden: A Novel;By Vernon, Olympia;"A hypnotic, lyrical debut novel about a young black girl in the deep south who comes to confront the realities of sex, race, disease, and death, by a writer of extraordinary emotional depth.?A profoundly raw and gripping read,” (The Baltimore Sun) Olympia Vernon’s fearless and wildly original debut novel explodes on the first page and sustains a tightrope intensity until the last. Set in Pyke County, Mississippi, Eden is a raw, heartbreaking, and enlightening novel that marks the emergence of a stunning and original talent. Narrated by fourteen-year-old Maddy Dangerfield, Eden opens in the moments after Maddy has impulsively drawn a naked woman on the pages of Genesis in bright red lipstick during Sunday service. The community is scandalized, and her devout, long-suffering mother’s response to her transgression is to force her to spend weekends nursing her dying Aunt Pip, an outcast who lives on the edge of town.From then on, Maddy must negotiate her two worlds: at the house where she lives with her hard-working, Bible-reading mother, Faye, and her father, Chevrolet?a one-armed drunk, gambler and womanizer?she is both a reluctant participant in and astute observer of the strange and confounding dynamics of her sometimes violent, sometimes tender family. (Years before, Maddy’s grandmother?her mother’s mother?chopped of Chevrolet’s arm and fed it to the pigs after he and Pip were found together in the back room as Faye entertained friends from the church?and ever since, he has been am emasculated, desperate man?drinking and gambling his wife’s money away, leaving her to clean up his mess time and again.) And then out on Commitment Road, she is caretaker to her Aunt Pip, whose only friend is her eccentric neighbor, Fat. Maddy’s time with Pip and Fat opens her eyes to the exhilaration of speaking your own mind, living your life on your own terms and without apology, and also to the cost extracted by both. She learns that there are strengths that belong to women alone, and also that there is a kind of ravaging vulnerability that is terrifying and inescapable, and uniquely female.The world Maddy inherits is one of injustice and hypocrisy, one that requires black people work for the whites for little to no pay; that sent her Uncle Sugar to jail for raping a white woman?no questions asked?when Maddy was just a baby; that preaches Christian love and forgiveness even as its actions reflect the very opposite. But Maddy soon learns that there is something that can work to oppose those truths, and that is knowledge; having the will and the ability to look beneath the surface, to question what others take as a given. By the end of the novel, newly acquainted with mortality and her own fierce strength, Maddy comes to bear both the burden and the blessing of that knowledge.In lush, vivid brushstrokes, Olympia Vernon conjures a world that is both intoxicating and cruel, and illuminates the bittersweet transformation of the young girl who must bear the burden and blessing of its secrets too soon. Eden is a haunting, memorable novel propelled by the poetry and power of a voice that is complex, lyrical, and utterly true."; Fiction , Literary;Grove Press;5.29;January;2004
Joe Egg;By Nichols, Peter;"This brilliantly written, deeply moving play about the problems of a young couple with a spastic daughter-the ""Joe Egg"" of the title-was described by Ronald Bryden in The Observer (London) as a ""remarkable play about a nightmare all women must have dreamed at some time, and most men: living with a child born so hopelessly crippled as to be, as the father in it says brutally, a human parsnip. For all that, it has to be described as a comedy, one of the funniest and most touching I've seen. The bridge between its form and content is a simple but brilliant stroke of theatre. Over the years, the author implies, explaining to others how one lives with such a situation becomes a kind of set party piece. This, savagely exaggerated, is what he has written-a recital, interspersed with jazz, imitations and tap-dances, about life with Joe Egg."""; Drama , European , English, Irish, Scottish, Welsh;Grove Press;4.99;January;1994
The Gilded Dome: The U.S. Senate and Campaign Finance Reform;By Kubiak, Greg D.;The Gilded Dome is Greg Kubiak's unique, inside view of a failed attempt to enact campaign finance reform in the U.S. Congress. This saga of Sen. David L. Boren's seven-year struggle to overcome Congressional self-interest and reach a bipartisan consensus demonstrates the power of moneyed interests that gridlocks government and stifles political competition.These efforts at campaign finance reform took shape in 1985, but not until 1987 - when Democrats regained control of the Senate - was Senator Boren's legislation taken seriously. In 1988, following a dramatic fifty-seven-hour session, a record-breaking cloture vote failed, and the money chase continued. Next the Senate and the House pushed to pass separate bills, but that effort failed as the Congress rushed to adjourn. Soon after the 1990 elections, the White House promised to kill the campaign finance reform bill. And just eleven days before a 1992 fundraising dinner at which donors paid $92,000 to be photographed with the president, the legislation was vetoed.In vivid detail The Gilded Dome describes negotiations to produce the most wide-ranging reform of campaign law since Watergate. In addition to describing efforts within Congress, the author explains how others - the media, lobbyists, and party officials - play the game and affect the legislative process. Kubiak concludes that the power of money in politics and the power of people in government must be balanced. Only then will the gilded dome, which conceals the power of money and special interests, reflect the beauty of our democracy.; Political Science , General;Univ of Oklahoma Pr;11.99;June;1994

Small Craft Advisory: A Book About the Building of a Boat;By Rubin, Louis Decimus;Small Craft Advisory is an enchanting book about Louis Rubin’s obsession with boats and his years of often hilarious boating adventures.When Louis Rubin was thirteen, he built a leaky little boat and paddled it out to the edge of the ship channel in Charleston, South Carolina, where he felt the inexorable pull of the water. Fifty years and dozens of boats later?sailboats, powerboats, inboards and outboards?the pull is as strong as ever.In the tradition established by Mark Twain, Joseph Conrad, and Herman Melville, distinguished author and scholar Louis Rubin explores man’s longtime passion for boats. He examines the compulsion that has prompted him and hundreds of thousands of other non-nautical persons to spend so much time, and no small portion of their incomes, on watercraft that they can use only infrequently.As his new boat (a cabin cruiser made of wood on a workboat hull) is being built, Rubin tells of his past boats and numerous boating disasters and draws a poignant comparison between his two passions: watercraft and the craft of writing.Anyone who has ever bought and owned a boat?or wondered why people are obsessed by them?will love this amusing, evocative, beautifully crafted memoir by an inveterate boat-owner.; Crafts & Hobbies , Woodwork;Atlantic Monthly Press;4.99;January;1994

God's Chinese Son: The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom of Hong Xiuquan;By Spence, Jonathan D.;"It is 1837 when Hong ascends to Heaven. While there, he is charged by God, his Heavenly Father - attired in black dragon robe and high-brimmed hat, his mouth almost hidden by his luxuriant golden beard - to slay the demon devils who are leading the people on earth astray. Their leader is Yan Luo, king of hell, the Dragon Demon of the Eastern Sea. Hong does battle in Heaven, armed by his father with sword and seal, aided by his elder brother, Jesus. Returned to his home village in south China, he resolves to carry on the struggle against the evil polluting humanity. He knows himself to be the younger brother of Jesus Christ, God's Chinese son.The Taiping uprising, led by Hong Xiuquan, was a massive millennial movement that, in its violent rise and fall between 1845 and 1864, cost at least twenty million Chinese their lives. In the course of this struggle the Taiping succeeded in overturning the authority of the ruling Qing dynasty throughout a massive territory in southern China. This the Taiping ruled as their Heavenly Kingdom from their seat in Nanjing for eleven years, until they were overcome in an apocalypse wrought by Qing and Western forces, the Book of Revelation become history.In this master work of the historian's art, Jonathan Spence creates a history of intimate detail and grand scale. We enter the fevered dream world of Hong Xiuquan as he meets his Heavenly family; we see the torments awaiting earthly sinners in King Yan Luo's hell; we feel the anxieties of Westerners living circumscribed lives on the edges of a China they do not understand. This is a China of vast instability, ruled by a dynasty in decline, beset by pirates and bandits in areas beyond the government's reach, pressed by Western traders to embrace opium, Western missionaries the word of God, and arms dealers the new weapons of the industrial revolution. Hong's movement ignites this volatile situation, and Spence captures the result on a breathtaking canvas of clashing armies, daring strategic thrusts, and protracted, deadly sieges. It is a story of historical power with striking resonances today."; History , Asia , China;W W Norton & Co Inc;8.78;December;1995

Stickin': The Case for Loyalty;By Carville, James;It's been said that if you want a friend in Washington, you should buy a dog. Unfortunately, there's some truth to that: there are few places in the world where the turncoats and careerists are so highly rewarded and where loyalty is equated with stupidity.  Luckily, another bit of wisdom about the Beltway is also true: the people in Washington aren't like the ones in the rest of the country. The American people treasure loyalty. They stick by a friend when he needs them. They forgive him when he's wrong. They understand the difference between politics and friendship. They are true to their ideals and their schools, loyal to their families and their God.  In Stickin', the always colorful and insightful political strategist James Carville, who has been accused of being loyal, examines this much-maligned and misunderstood political good. Along the way, he looks at loyalty in the family and among friends, in theory and in practice. He praises some loyal people and skewers some deserving backstabbers. And, of course, it wouldn't be a Carville book if he didn't provide recipes for some good home cooking.; Political Science , American Government , General;Simon & Schuster;5.29;January;2000

The Last Time They Met: A Novel;By Shreve, Anita;"Linda Fallon encounters her former lover, Thomas Janes, at a literary festival where both have been invited to give readings from their work. It has been years since their paths crossed, and in that time Thomas has become a kind of literary legend. His renown is enhanced by his elusiveness; for most of the past decade, he has remained in seclusion following a devastating loss.This is no chance meeting. Thomas learned that Linda was reading at the festival and chose this moment to reestablish contact with a woman he passionately pursued years earlier. Their affair was disastrous, and a turning point in both their lives. Neither the intensity of their relationship nor the damage it did has ever been far from his memory.From the moment they speak, The Last Time They Met unfolds the story of Linda and Thomas in an extraordinary way: it travels back into their past, bypassing layers of memory and interpretation to present their earlier encounters with unshakable immediacy. In Africa, when Linda and Thomas were twenty-seven, and in Massachusetts, when they were in high school, the novel re-creates love at its exhilirating pinnacle - the kind of intense connection that becomes the true north against which all relationships are measured.Moving backward through time, The Last Time They Met traces the shocking resonance a single choice, even a single word, can have over the course of a lifetime. At the same time, the novel creates an almost unbearable mystery, a mystery that can be understood fully only in the novel's final pages, in the eyes of young Linda Fallon and the young man who loves her."; Fiction , Romance , General;Little, Brown and Company;5.37;April;2001

What to Expect When You're Expecting;By Eisenberg, Arlene;Announcing a brand new, cover-to-cover revision of America's pregnancy bible. What to Expect When You're Expecting is a perennial New York Times bestseller and one of USA Today's 25 most influential books of the past 25 years.

It's filled with the most up-to-date information reflecting not only what's new in pregnancy, but what's relevant to pregnant women. Heidi Murkoff has rewritten every section of the book, answering dozens of new questions and including loads of new asked-for material, such as a detailed week-by-week fetal development section in each of the monthly chapters, an expanded chapter on pre-conception, and a brand new one on carrying multiples. More comprehensive, reassuring, and empathetic than ever, the Fourth Edition incorporates the most recent developments in obstetrics and addresses the most current lifestyle trends (from tattooing and belly piercing to Botox and aromatherapy). There's more than ever on pregnancy matters practical (including an expanded section on workplace concerns), physical (with more symptoms, more solutions), emotional (more advice on riding the mood roller coaster), nutritional (from low-carb to vegan, from junk food–dependent to caffeine-addicted), and sexual (what's hot and what's not in pregnant lovemaking), as well as much more support for that very important partner in parenting, the dad-to-be. Overflowing with tips, helpful hints, and humor (a pregnant woman's best friend), this new edition is more accessible and easier to use than ever before.

Brown: The Last Discovery of America;By Rodriguez, Richard;"America is browning. As politicians, schoolteachers, and grandparents attempt to decipher what that might mean, Richard Rodriguez argues America has been brown from its inception, as he himself is.  As a brown man, I think . . .  (But do we really think that color colors thought?)  In his two previous memoirs, Hunger of Memory and Days of Obligation, Rodriguez wrote about the intersection of his private life with public issues of class and ethnicity. With Brown, his consideration of race, Rodriguez completes his ""trilogy on American public life.""  For Rodriguez, brown is not a singular color. Brown is evidence of mixture. Brown is a shade created by desire-an emblem of the erotic history of America, which began the moment the African and the European met within the Indian eye. Rodriguez reflects on various cultural associations of the color brown-toil, decay, impurity, time-arranging dazzling juxtapositions for which he is justly famous: Alexis de Tocqueville, Malcolm X, minstrel shows, Broadway musicals, Puritanism, the Sistine Chapel, Cubism, homosexuality, and the influence on his life of two federal figures-Ben Franklin and Richard Nixon (""the dark father of Hispanicity"").  At the core of the book is an assessment of the meaning of Hispanics to the life of America. Reflecting upon the new demographic profile of our country, Rodriguez observes that Hispanics are becoming Americanized at the same rate that the United States is becoming Latinized. Hispanics are coloring an American identity that traditionally has chosen to describe itself as black and white."; Biography & Autobiography , Cultural Heritage;Viking Adult;4.99;April;2002

Learning to Fly;By Conrad, Charlie (EDT) and Keen, Sam;"The acclaimed author of Fire in the Belly presents an exhilarating memoir of his late-blooming love affair with the flying trapeze--and a provocative look at the potential it offers for growth and transformation.Since he first experienced the joy and freedom of flight while swinging from trees as a boy in Alabama and Tennessee, Sam Keen dreamed of being able to fly. But it was only when, at age sixty-one, he happened upon a trapeze training program at the San Francisco School of Circus Arts that he took up the quest in earnest. After ascending to the platform thirty-one feet in the air and grasping the trapeze bar, Keen dove into the ocean of emptiness above the net, lost in the pleasure of swinging. Returning to the trapeze again and again, he gradually developed the poise and confidence that allowed him to release himself from the bar and soar--airborne--into the hands of a catcher. Having tasted the elation of actual flight, Keen's childhood dream became a passion and a vehicle for exploring the challenges and dilemmas of life.In Learning to Fly, Keen traces the life journey that led him to respond to the lure of the trapeze late in his life and shares what his five years of intensive practice have taught him about living more intensely and passionately. He also recounts how his recognition of this art form's transcendent powers led him to launch Upward Bound, a trapeze workshop for anyone facing deeply rooted fears.An unprecedented adventure of the soul and psyche, Learning to Fly teaches us to soar on the wings of possibility as we watch Keen and his students progress through breathtaking exercises. As he describes take-offs and knee hangs and thrilling mid-air catches, Keen imparts moving revelations about risk-taking, trust, bravado, true strength, falling, and letting go. Guiding us on a remarkable inner journey through the ""circus of the mind,"" Learning to Fly reveals the grace of ascending in body and spirit--and living with levity.A film documentary of Learning to Fly is also available on video, produced by Quest Productions based in Berkeley, CA."; Performing Arts , Circus;Harmony;5.29;May;1999

The Politics of Truth: A Diplomat's Memoir: Inside the Lies that Led to War and Betrayed My Wife's CIA Identity;By Wilson, Joseph;With a new investigative epilogue by a prominent Washington journalist and a new foreword by the author. Ambassador Joseph Wilson recounts more than two decades of foreign service to our country in this unprecedented look at the life of an American diplomat and an unabashed account of policies that sometimes succeeded and sometimes failed. As the last American official to meet with Saddam before Desert Storm, Wilson successfully parried the dictator's threats to use American hostages as human shields against U.S. bombing. Yet today he finds himself battling threats from his own government because he called a lie a lie. When President Bush alleged that Iraq had pursued uranium from Africa for its nuclear weapons program, Wilson could not stand silent. He had traveled to Niger the previous year and found no evidence to support the president's claim. To intimidate Wilson, senior administration officials disclosed the undercover status of Wilson's wife, CIA operative Valerie Plame, to the press, putting her life in danger. Rather than backing down, Wilson persistently criticized the way the administration misled the nation into war. Now he continues his fight in this groundbreaking book by revealing the perils bred by the war-hungry regime in the White House.; Political Science , American Government , General;PublicAffairs;10.99;April;2005

Misfortune;By Stace, Wesley;On a moonlit night on the outskirts of London, Lord Geoffroy Loveall finds the answers to his prayers: an abandoned baby, somehow still alive amid the junk of a rubbish heap. Rescuing the infant from certain death, Lord Geoffroy adopts her as his only child, heir to the fabulous Love Hall fortune. He names her Rose in memory of his long-dead, endlessly mourned sister and gives her a childhood of unparalleled gaiety and unstinting pleasure.But every house has a secret, and as Rose approaches adolescence, the secret of Love Hall becomes impossible to hide. As much as Lord Geoffroy wanted a daughter, the baby he brought home is, in fact, a boy. Lace petticoats and expensive frocks cannot disguise what blooms just beneath. Lady Rose has never been a girl, and it is Rose himself who is most bewildered by the revelation.As a flock of outraged relatives circles, each clamoring for a share of the family riches, Rose has no choice but to flee. He must abandon the luxury and safety of his beloved home and travel halfway around the world to begin to understand who he really is - and to unlock the secret of his rightful place.; Fiction , Psychological;Little, Brown and Company;10.99;April;2005

It also presents the latest information on what makes up a healthy diet and on the connection between diet and disease prevention.Each entry shows you how to select the freshest high-quality foods, and how to store and cook them (Did you know that thumping a melon is useless as a test for ripeness? Or that you should never store potatoes in the refrigerator?) Highlighted nutritional profiles display key nutrients at a glance. Throughout the book, you'll find charts and boxes filled with tips, advice, and fascinating facts. And there are literally hundreds of delicious serving suggestions for main dishes, snacks, desserts, and more - all proving that a healthy diet isn't a matter of limiting your choices, but of increasing the variety of foods you eat.Every fact draws on the expertise of the School of Public Health at the University of California at Berkeley - an institution at the forefront of examining the link between diet and health, and the authority behind the nation's leading health newsletter, the University of California at Berkeley Wellness Letter.

THE WEST An Illustrated History;By Ward, Geoffrey C. and Duncan, Dayton;"In a vivid narrative that begins with the arrival of the first Europeans and ends well into the twentieth century, author Geoffrey C. Ward provides a gripping journey through the turbulent history of the region that has come to symbolize America around the world. Drawing upon hundreds of letters, diaries, memoirs, and journals as well as the latest scholarship. The West chronicles the arrival of wave after wave of newcomers from every direction of the compass, each of which invested the harsh but majestic western landscape with its own myths and desires and dreams.The cast is as rich and diverse as the western landscape itself - explorers and soldiers and Indian warriors, settlers and railroad builders and gaudy showmen. Coronado and Custer, Jesse James and Chief Joseph and Brigham Young and Buffalo Bill are all here. But so are scores of lesser-known westerners whose stories are no less compelling - a Chinese ditchdiggger and a rich Mexican landowner, a forty-niner from Chile and a Texas cowboy born in Britain, a woman missionary to the Indians who loathed the West and a Wellesley graduate who loved it in spite of everything it did to her and her family.The West explores the tensions between whites and the native peoples they sought to displace, but it also encompasses the Hispanic experience in the West, from the time of the conquistadors to the transformation of a Mexican-American village called Los Angeles into the region's major metropolis; the lives of Chinese immigrants who called the region ""Gold Mountain""; and the ordeals of freed slaves from the South who sought a better life homesteading on the Great Plains.With essays by distinguished historians and writers about the West: Dayton Duncan, John Mack Faragher, David G.

The Oresteia;By Aeschylus;Highly acclaimed as translators of Greek and Sanskrit classics, respectively, David Grene and Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty here present a complete modern translation of the three plays comprising Aeschylus' Orestia and, with the assistance of director Nicholas Rudall, an abridged stage adaptation. This blanced and highly successful collaboration of scholars with a theater director solves the contemporary problems of translating and staging the Orestia, which originally was written to be performed in Athens in the first half of the fifth century B.C. While remaning faithful to the original Greek, Grene and O'Flaherty embrace a strong and adventurous English style, vivid and visceral. The language of this extraordinary translation, immediately accessible to a theater audience, speaks across the centuries. Premiered at Chicago's Court Theater in 1986 under Rudall's direction, the stage adaptation of the Orestia proved eminently playable.  This new adaptation of the orestia offers a brilliant demonstration of how clearly defined goals (here, the actor's needs) can inspire translators to produce fresh, genuine, accessible dramatic texts. The resulting work provides complete and accurate texts for those who cannot read the original Greek, and it transforms the Orestia into an effective modern stage play. With interpretive introductions written by the translators and director, this new version will be welcomed by teachers of translation courses, by students of Greek and world drama in general, and by theater professionals.; Drama , Ancient & Classical;University of Chicago Press;5.29;March;1989

Drover and the Designated Hitter (Drover, No 3);By Granger, Bill;"Ex-sportswriter Jimmy Drover is a cross between Breslin and Bogart: the contemporary hard-bitten tough guy in his purest form. Formerly a prizewinning sports reporter for a Los Angeles newspaper, Drover found his luck running out when there surfaced a picture of him in the company of some Chicago wise guys. They weren't doing business; Drover was just catching up with some guys he knew from growing up in the streets. But a U.S. attorney with ulterior motives got him fired from his paper, and Drover's life was upended.Now he lives in Santa Cruz, trading stories and killing time at a local bar with a crew of good-natured, trustworthy lazybones. To make ends meet, he works off and on for Fox Vernon, a legendary Las Vegas oddsmaker. Vernon needs a scout, a busybody - and so Drover makes a living by using his intuitions and sports world knowledge, talking his way into locker rooms, gambling dens, mobsters' and managers' offices, traveling around the country in pursuit of sports world info that might affect the odds on Sunday's game.Drover is called into an investigation of Homer White, whose heavy-hitting baseball career with the Chicago Cubs has gone into a slump after leg injuries. Homer's suspected of gambling - easy enough for Drover to check up on, given his above- and below-board contacts. But as Drover gets more of the lowdown, the picture becomes more deadly: Some people want to sabotage Homer's career - including his bitter ex-wife. Some want to save it - including his beautiful rehab nurse, Helen Brown. Trying to learn the hidden story, Drover steps into a knotty web of threats and violent passions and finds himself again under suspicion - and under the gun.The third in Bill Granger's best-selling Drover series, Drover and the Designated Hitter comes through again with Granger's vivid panorama of modern sports world detail and Drover's caustic, seen-it-all wit."; Fiction , Mystery & Detective , General;William Morrow & Co;21.95;May;1994

D Day: June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II;By Ambrose, Stephen E.;Stephen E. Ambrose’s D-Day is the definitive history of World War II’s most pivotal battle, a day that changed the course of history.D-Day is the epic story of men at the most demanding moment of their lives, when the horrors, complexities, and triumphs of life are laid bare. Distinguished historian Stephen E. Ambrose portrays the faces of courage and heroism, fear and determination—what Eisenhower called “the fury of an aroused democracy”—that shaped the victory of the citizen soldiers whom Hitler had disparaged.Drawing on more than 1,400 interviews with American, British, Canadian, French, and German veterans, Ambrose reveals how the original plans for the invasion had to be abandoned, and how enlisted men and junior officers acted on their own initiative when they realized that nothing was as they were told it would be.  The action begins at midnight, June 5/6, when the first British and American airborne troops jumped into France. It ends at midnight June 6/7. Focusing on those pivotal twenty-four hours, it moves from the level of Supreme Commander to that of a French child, from General Omar Bradley to an American paratrooper, from Field Marshal Montgomery to a German sergeant.  Ambrose’s D-Day is the finest account of one of our history’s most important days.; History , Military , United States;Simon & Schuster;8.79;June;1995

Milne and Fran Lebowitz. Following in the paw prints of 101 SALIVATIONS, Rachael Hale's 101 CATACLYSMS is a charming and playful tribute to the world's most popular pet.

Healing and the Mind;By Moyers, Bill D., Flowers, Betty S., and Grubin, David;"Ancient medical science told us our minds and bodies are one. So did philosophers of old. Now, modern science and new research are helping us to understand these connections. In Healing and the Mind, Bill Moyers talks with physicians, scientists, therapists, and patients - people who are taking a new look at the meaning of sickness and health. In a series of fascinating and provocative interviews, he discusses their search for answers to perplexing questions: How do emotions translate into chemicals in our bodies? How do thoughts and feelings influence health? How can we collaborate with our bodies to encourage healing?Healing and the Mind travels from small private clinics to large public hospitals to examine how advances in mind/body medicine are being applied on a day-to-day level in the hurried and technology-driven world of modern medicine. From neonatal care to geriatrics, from day surgery to the treatment of chronic illness, medical professionals are finding that when they practice the ""new medicine,"" their patients heal faster, leave the hospital sooner, and do better once they get home.Bill Moyers and David Grubin also travel to the People's Republic of China. There they explore the implications of that country's fusion of Western practices with traditional Chinese medicine, including acupuncture, massage, herbal potions, and the mysterious concept called chi. They take an intimate look at alternate therapy programs, including a Massachusetts medical center that combines Eastern meditation with Western therapy in the treatment of ailments as diverse as hypertension and chronic back pain. And they visit a California retreat where cancer patients help each other discover that healing can occur even when a cure is impossible.With the incisive style that has made Bill Moyers's skills as an interviewer legendary, and the dynamic interplay of text and art that has made his previous books international bestsellers, Healing and the Mind is a landmark work, destined to influence how America thinks about sickness and health."; Health & Fitness , Healing;Doubleday;8.79;January;1993

Wild Animals and American Environmental Ethics;By Mighetto, Lisa;"Long before the Endangered Species Act and the spotted owl controversy, American conservationists debated the ethics of wildlife protection.  Although all were alarmed by the rapid destruction of game species in the late 1800s, some sought to preserve animals for their aesthetic and material benefit to humans, while others believed it was wrong to mistreat any wild creature.  Wild Animals and American Environmental Ethics shows how the latter view evolved into the animal rights activism of today.  Lisa Mighetto examines portrayals of wildlife in popular literature dating from the nineteenth century, revealing how early conservationists looked for evidence of morality in animals that would make them more acceptable to the American public.  Arguing that animals should be protected because they think, feel, and act in a manner similar to humans, some went so far as to claim that these creatures have rights.    Not all wild animals readily conformed to the new image.  The first conservationists did not extend their ethics to predators or ""varmints,"" and supported government efforts to wipe them out.  By describing how animal lovers gradually came to advocate protection of even these creatures, Mighetto traces the development of modern ecological values and the biocentric perspective.  Americans now stand at a critical point in wildlife protection, wielding the threat of extinction over numerous species.  Mighetto places arguments regarding wildlife protection in historical perspective and thus helps us evaluate our inherited attitudes and assumptions about the animal world.  Enhancing the text are more than fifty illustrations that demonstrate the interaction between humans and wildlife over the last century."; Philosophy , General;University of Arizona Press;4.99;September;1991

The Color of Truth: McGeorge Bundy and William Bundy: Brothers in Arms;By Bird, Kai;"The Color of Truth is the definitive biography of McGeorge Bundy and William Bundy, two of ""the best and the brightest"" who advised presidents about peace and war during the most dangerous years of the Cold War. The Bundy brothers embodied all the idealism and hubris that animated American foreign policy in the decades after World War II. They will be remembered forever as anti-communist liberals who, despite their grave doubts about sending Americans to fight in Southeast Asia, became key architects of America's war in Vietnam.  Kai Bird, the author of The Chairman, the acclaimed biography of John J. McCloy, brilliantly recreates the world of Boston Brahmin privilege in which the Bundy brothers were reared to govern. Educated at Groton, Yale and Harvard, Mac and Bill Bundy were protégés of Henry Stimson, Dean Acheson and Justice Felix Frankfurter, and their friends and admirers included Walter Lippmann, Joseph Alsop and J. Robert Oppenheimer. Bill played a major role in the supersecret ULTRA code-breaking project that proved invaluable to the Allies' victory over Nazi Germany. Mac, a key military aide, was present at D-day and later wrote Stimson's influential but misleading essay explaining Truman's decision to use the atomic bomb.  In the 1950s, both brothers became ensnared in Senator Joseph McCarthy's witchhunts against suspected communists in government and academia. As dean of Harvard College, Mac fought to protect his tenured faculty while sacrificing junior scholars who refused to ""name names"" to the FBI. Bill, a high-ranking CIA official, saw his career nearly destroyed when McCarthy learned he had contributed money to Alger Hiss's defense fund. Bill's refusal to testify before the senator's committee was a turning point in the battle against McCarthyism.  The brothers reached the apex of the national security establishment under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. Kennedy appointed Mac Bundy to be his national security adviser, and Bill Bundy moved into senior positions at the Pentagon and the State Department. One or the other was involved in many of the triumphs and deceits of the Kennedy years, including the Bay of Pigs fiasco, plots to eliminate Fidel Castro and the Cuban Missile Crisis. But it was their role in guiding the nation to war in Vietnam that engulfed them in controversy and indelibly marked them as failed figures in American history.  At every stage of the war -- from the assassination of South Vietnamese president Diem in 1963 to the Gulf of Tonkin incident in 1964, from the bombing campaign of Operation Rolling Thunder to President Johnson's July 1965 decision to send hundreds of thousands of U.S. combat troops to Vietnam -- the Bundy brothers were present, urging a policy of gradual escalation. Long after Johnson had dismissed their warning that Vietnam could become a ""white man's war"" on the Asian mainland, the Bundys remained loyal to their liberal president, who was determined not to allow right-wing critics to accuse him of losing another Asian country to communism. Even after Mac left the government in 1966 to become the controversial president of the Ford Foundation, he remained silent on the war. Bill stayed on in Washington until 1969, prosecuting a war he knew was unwinnable.  Based on nearly a hundred interviews with the Bundy brothers, their families and colleagues, and on thousands of pages of archival documents -- including some White House memos that remain classified -- Bird's account contains dramatic new information that alters the history of the Vietnam War. Like the bestselling The Wise Men, this dual biography is both an inside account of the making of U.S. foreign policy in an era of nuclear weapons and a stunning group portrait of the heirs of the Wise Men -- including Robert McNamara, George Ball and Robert Kennedy -- and the presidents they served.

Justice William J. Brennan, Jr: Freedom First;By Gallen, David, Goldman, Roger, and Brennan, William J;Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. sat for thirty-four years on the United States Supreme Court. Throughout his tenure on the Court he meticulously examined the body of Constitutional law - and effectively resuscitated its spirit. A champion of minorities and a spokesman for the politically dispossessed, he passionately defended civil rights and strove to bring the nation's disenfranchised into the mainstream of American life. He advanced the political empowerment of American cities and suburbs. He essentially wrote the modern law of freedom of speech and the press.Justice Brennan's retirement in 1990 occasioned tributes from a host of associates, former law clerks, attorneys, judges, professors, journalists, and friends. The reflections on Brennan in Part I of this volume provide intimate, often humorous glimpses into a generous, warm, open-hearted man who also happened to be an intellectual giant and outstanding jurist.In Part II the jurisprudence of Justice Brennan is comprehensively surveyed and lucidly discussed by author and Constitutional law professor Roger Goldman. With care he examines - and in layman's terms explains - Brennan's positions on the issues central to the justice's career: the First Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, civil rights, education, abortion, obscenity, and capital punishment.Eloquent, persuasive, and faithful to his vision, Justice Brennan authored more than a thousand opinions, concurrences, and dissents in the course of his judicial career. Part III of the book offers twelve landmark decisions written by Brennan that show clearly why history will place him beside John Marshall, Louis Brandeis, and Oliver Wendell Holmes as one of the truly great justices in the annals of the United States Supreme Court.; Law , General;Carroll & Graf Pub;5.53;September;1994

Witness to Hope: The Biography of Pope John Paul II;By Weigel, George;"Given unprecedented access to Pope John Paul II and the people who have known and worked with him throughout his life, George Weigel presents a groundbreaking portrait of the Pope as a man, a thinker, and a leader whose religious convictions have defined a new approach to world politics -- and changed the course of history.  John Paul II has systematically addressed every major question on the world's agenda at the turn of the millennium: the human yearning for the sacred, the meaning of freedom, the glories and challenges of human sexuality, the promise of the women's movement, the quest for a new world order, the nature of good and evil, the moral challenge of prosperity, and the imperative of human solidarity in the emerging global civilization.By bringing the age-old wisdom of biblical religion into active conversation with contemporary life and thought, the Pope ""from a far country"" has crafted a challenging proposal for the human future that is without parallel in the modern world.  Weigel explores new information about the Pope's role in some of the recent past's most stirring events, including the fall of communism; the Vatican/Israel negotiation of 1991-92; the collapse of the Philippine, Chilean, Nicaraguan, and Paraguayan dictatorships during the 1980s; and the epic papal visit to Cuba. Weigel also includes previously unpublished papal correspondence with Leonid Brezhnev, Mikhail Gorbachev, and Deng Xiaoping, and draws on hitherto unavailable autobiographical reminiscences by the Pope.  Witness to Hope also discusses the Pope's efforts to build bridges to other Christian communities, and to Judaism, Islam, and other great world religions; presents an analysis of John Paul's proposals for strengthening democratic societies in the twenty-first century; and offers synopses of every major teaching document in the pontificate.  Rounding out the dramatic story of Pope John Paul II are fresh translations of his poetry; detailed personal anecdotes of the Pope as a young man, priest, and friend, sketched by those who knew him best; and in-depth interviews with Catholic leaders throughout the world.  A magisterial biography of one of the most important figures -- some might argue, the most important figure -- of the twentieth century, Witness to Hope is an extraordinary testimony to the man and his accomplishments, and a papal biography unlike any other."; Biography & Autobiography , Religious;Harper Perennial;10.99;April;2001
Six Wives: The Queens of Henry VIII;By Starkey, David;No one in history had a more eventful career in matrimony than Henry VIII. His marriages were daring and tumultuous, and made instant legends of six very different women. In this remarkable study, David Starkey argues that the king was not a depraved philanderer but someone seeking happiness -- and a son. Knowingly or not, he elevateda group of women to extraordinary heights and changed the way a nation was governed.Six Wives is a masterful work of history that intimately examines the rituals of diplomacy, marriage, pregnancy, and religion that were part of daily life for women at the Tudor Court. Weaving new facts and fresh interpretations into a spellbinding account of the emotional drama surrounding Henry's six marriages, David Starkey reveals the central role that the queens played in determining policy. With an equally keen eye for romantic and political intrigue, he brilliantly recaptures the story of Henry's wives and the England they ruled.; Biography & Autobiography , Historical;Harper Perennial;5.68;May;2004

Direct From Dell: Strategies That Revolutionized an Industry;By Dell, Michael and Fredman, Catherine;"In 1983, Michael S. Dell, then an incoming freshman at the University of Texas at Austin, drove away from his parents' Houston home in a white BMW  he'd bought selling subscriptions to his hometown newspaper. In the backseat were three personal computers.  Today, he is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Dell Computer Corporation, an $18 billion company, the second-largest manufacturer and marketer of computers in the world. Founded on a deceptively simple premise--to deliver high-performance computer systems directly to the end user--Dell Computer is the envy of its competition, constantly growing at five  times the industry rate, and a perennial darling of Wall Street: its stock is up more than 36,000 percent this decade, and more than 200 percent in the last year.  In  Direct From Dell, Michael Dell himself tells the incredible story of Dell Computer's successful rise, beginning in his college dorm room with $1,000 in capital.  In these pages, you'll see the formation of a great visionary--and a great company. You'll meet the young Dell who, at the tender age of eight, had already begun looking ""to eliminate unnecessary steps"" and who, as a numbers-loving adolescent, was inspired by a newfound fascination with computers to save his money to buy a coveted Apple II--only to promptly take it apart. You'll encounter a young visionary who, upon witnessing  the inefficiencies of an exploding industry, challenged conventional wisdom and set out to do nothing less than  beat IBM at its own game. In so doing, Dell forever changed the way things ""had always been done"" in the computer industry.  You'll also see the birth of a Dell  hallmark--the direct model--which, in its ability to reach the customer directly, eliminated not only a substantial middleman markup but also the possibility of costly excess inventory, setting the stage for other extraordinary achievements. In an industry notorious for its unreliable service, Dell utilized its direct customer relationships to pioneer the concept of customer ""support""--and didn't rest until the caliber of its service was rivaled only by the quality of its products and its speed of delivery.  But the story of Dell Computer is no fairy tale. Marked by uncharacteristically rapid growth, the company was faced with challenges that could have threatened its very existence. From forays into retail to under- (and over-) developed product lines, Dell learned some hard lessons along the way--and emerged stronger as a result.  The strategies born of those times--unrivaled speed to market; superior customer service; a fierce commitment to producing  constantly high-quality custom-made systems--heralded what has perhaps been the company's crowning achievement: an early exploitation of the Internet. One of the first companies to actually make money online, Dell is now selling more than $12 million worth of systems per day over www.dell.com.  Not just for CEOs or those in high tech, the strategies revealed in Direct From Dell are invaluable to managers in a broad cross section of industries. From starting a successful business to pioneering computer sales and service over the Internet, Dell shares his perspectives on:  Why it's infinitely better for any business starting out to have too little capital, rather than too much  How studying your customers--not your competition--will give you a greater competitive edge  Why it can be life-threatening to your company to pursue too many good ideas--or to grow too fast  Why it's essential to run a P&L on every area of your business  Why your people prose a greater threat to the health of your business than your competition does  How you can exploit your competition's weakness by exposing its greatest strength  How integrating your business virtually can make the difference between being quick--and being dead  Revealing nothing less than a new model for doing business in the information age, Direct From Dell is both an extraordinary business success story and a manifesto for revolutionizing any industry."; Computers , Computer Science;Harper Business;5.29;February;1999

Along the Inca Road: A Woman's Journey into an Ancient Empire (Adventure Press);By Muller, Karin;One of the engineering wonders of the world, the Inca Road was built more than five hundred years ago to link the far-flung outposts of a fabled empire -- an empire that ruled in golden splendor until the conquistadors arrived to plunder El Dorado and put a swift, cruel end to its extraordinary culture. But its legend survives in the masterful masonry of its paving blocks and the ruined glory of ghost cities such as Cuzco. In this vivid, free-wheeling expedition, Karin Muller travels the ancient route to explore its dramatic history and discover new adventures along its length and breadth.  Along the Inca Road shares the stillness of sunrise in the haunted aerie of Machu Picchu, clings to the roof of a rattletrap bus skirting the vertiginous precipices of the Andes, carouses through the streets of an Altiplano city on Carnival, and inches warily forward as Ecuadorian soldiers probe for land mines with bayonets. Muller's ready for just about anything, whether it's challenging the Pacific surf in a traditional Inca reed boat, locking horns with a bull in a cheering Peruvian arena, or joining a crack Bolivian anti-narcotics team on a hunt for clandestine cocaine labs deep in the jungle. She initiates us into the mysteries of the spirits at a shaman's rite involving hamsters, hallucinogens, and copious libations of moonshine, and high in a mountain meadow captures a struggling vicuna, whose prized silky fleece once was reserved for the Inca god-king alone. And these are only a few of the traveler's tales from a 3,125-mile odyssey encompassing four countries and every form of transportation under the sun, from footslogging, mule train, and motorbike to state-of-the-art military vehicles.  As she spins the wool of her stories into a modern tapestry of faces and memories, Muller intertwines a chronicle of the ancient Inca from their race's mythical birth on an island in lofty Lake Titicaca to their sudden plunge from the height of imperial power at the hands of a ragtag band of Spanish soldiers of fortune. We learn how they lived, worshipped, and warred, and why such a magnificent culture proved so vulnerable to invaders.  As spectacular as the mountainscapes that are its breathtaking backdrop, Along the Inca Road is a wonderful panorama of past and present -- the kind of sharply observed portrait of a unique part of the world and its colorful people that displays the art of travel literature at its best.; Travel , Special Interest , Adventure;National Geographic;5.64;September;2000

In his tell-it-like-it-is style that already has influenced millions of Oprah viewers, ""Dr. Phil"" blows the whistle on the rhetoric of traditional ""couples therapy"" and instead tells you that--no matter what state your relationship is in--not only are you responsible for it, you are responsible for getting it back on track.

Cleopatra (Pocket Biographies);By Rice, Edward E.;Cleopatra ruled Ptolemaic Egypt from 51-30 B.C., and was the last Macedonian ruler of that country. She first ruled jointly with her brothers/husbands Ptolemy XIII and Ptolemy XIV, but her romantic liaisons with two of the most famous Romans of their day ensured Cleopatra's undying fame and place in history. Her relationship with Julius Caesar established her firmly upon the throne. When Caesar was assassinated on the Ides of March in 44 B.C., Cleopatra returned from Rome to Egypt and began an ill-fated love affair with the brilliant but self-indulgent Roman commander, Marc Antony. Their relationship was bitterly opposed by his brother-in-law Octavian (who became Emperor Augustus), and in 32 B.C. Rome declared war on Egypt. A decisive naval defeat at the Battle of Actium, off the west coast of Greece, sent the lovers back to Egypt where they committed suicide as Octavian captured the city - Cleopatra allegedly killing herself with an asp after Antony fell upon his sword.; Biography & Autobiography , Historical;Sutton Publishing;5.29;January;1999

Stolen Honey (Ruth Willmarth Mysteries);By Wright, Nancy Means;"Donna Woodleaf-LeBlanc and Emily Willmarth, both eighteen and in their first year of college, have looked down their noses at college football games and frat parties. So Gwen Woodleaf is surprised when her daughter announces that a frat party will keep them up late that evening. ""The school is banning men-only fraternities next term,"" Donna explains, ""so it's the last chance to get the experience of it.""The ""experience,"" however, turns out to be a great deal more than the young women bargained for: the youth who drives Donna home on his motorcycle is found dead on the Woodleaf-LeBlancs' grounds the next morning. It is unclear how the young man, who had more than his share of alcohol the night before, died, and the police are asking questions.To some of the local people, the family is suspect to start with. Russell, Donna's father, is part Abenaki and an actor who gets himself up in full Native American regalia and plays an eighteenth-century brave in frequent Revolutionary War reenactments. His wife, Gwen, has inherited Woodleaf Apiaries from her beekeeper father-- at least two hundred hives scattered about the New England countryside, requiring skill and attention if the honey crop is to bring in any money. Gwen is also the subject of gossip because she grows marijuana and belladonna for medicinal purposes.Shep Noble's death begins to seem more and more like murder than accident, and his death and the LeBlancs' ""differentness"" incite anonymous threats and harassment from local troublemakers who make Donna's life miserable.Desperate, she turns to a neighbor, and Emily's mother, Ruth Willmarth, as so many others of the community have done in the past. Ruth, abandoned by her husband, is struggling to raise their children and keep her farm going with little help and even less income. But that doesn't stop her from doing what she can to comfort Donna. She urges her persistent suitor, Colm Hanna, a funeral director and part-time police officer, to go more deeply into the mystery of Shep's death than his police colleagues are doing.Meanwhile, Donna is researching a paper for her sociology class, weaving it around the story of her Vermont family, with its Native American and French Canadian roots. But tragedy dogs her when her sociology professor is strangled. As Ruth and Colm try to unravel the tangle of the two deaths, it becomes clear that both deaths, as well as the family history Donna is digging into, are coming together in a clashing climax that will leave none of the players unchanged."; Fiction , Mystery & Detective , General;Minotaur Books;4.99;April;2002

Salud!;By Delgado, Jane L. and National Hispanic Women's Health Initiative;For reasons ranging from the cultural to the physiological, Latinas have unique concerns when it comes to their health: they metabolize drugs differently, are more likely to develop cervical cancer, have a higher rate of diabetes, and are more likely to die from liver disease than other ethnic groups. Yet despite the fact that Hispanics are the fastest-growing population in America, very few resources address their special health needs.   Salud! is the first comprehensive reader-friendly health guide specifically designed with the Hispanic woman in mind. The first part of the book examines the problems Latinas often face in the new health care system, arming them with the real-life strategies they need to overcome them. Part two looks at female health problems from a Hispanic perspective, offering expert advice and the most up-to-date findings. Part three covers the diseases and disorders to which Latinas are especially vulnerable, and part four focuses on helping them maintain their health and achieve overall wellness.  Sensitively written by a Latina health care professional and featuring a combination of state-of-the-art medicine, advice, and anecdotes from Latinas, Salud! emphasizes a practical approach to staying healthy that is geared to Hispanic tastes and values. It is the guide the Latina community has been waiting for.; Health & Fitness , Women's Health;HarpPeren;5.29;September;1997

Flyboys: A True Story of Courage;By Bradley, James;James Bradley's #1 bestseller Flags of Our Fathers made real the humanity and legacy of war as few books had before. Now, in Flyboys, Bradley returns to World War II and an extraordinary-and totally unknown-true story of courage.Over the remote Pacific island of Chichi Jima, nine American flyers-Navy and Marine pilots sent to bomb Japanese communications towers there-were shot down. One of those nine was miraculously rescued by a U.S. Navy submarine. The others were captured by Japanese soldiers on Chichi Jima and held prisoner.Then they disappeared.When the war was over, the American government, along with the Japanese, covered up everything that had happened on Chichi Jima. The records of a top-secret military tribunal were sealed, the lives of the eight Flyboys were erased, and the parents, brothers, sisters, and sweethearts they left behind were left to wonder.Flyboys reveals for the first time ever the extraordinary story of those men. Bradley's quest for the truth took him from dusty attics in American small towns, to untapped government archives containing classified documents, to the heart of Japan, and finally to Chichi Jima itself. What he discovered was a mystery that dated back far before World War II-back 150 years, to America's westward expansion and Japan's first confrontation with the western world.Bradley brings into vivid focus these brave young men who went to war for their country, and through their lives he also tells the larger story of two nations in a hellish war. With no easy moralizing, Bradley presents history in all its savage complexity, including the Japanese warrior mentality that fostered inhuman brutality and the U.S. military strategy that justified attacks on millions of civilians. And, after almost sixty years of mystery, Bradley finally reveals the fate of the eight American Flyboys, all of whom would ultimately face a moment and a decision that few of us can even imagine.Flyboys is a story of war and horror but also of friendship and honor. It is about how we die, and how we live-including the tale of the Flyboy who escaped capture, a young Navy pilot named George H. W. Bush who would one day become president of the United States. A masterpiece of historical narrative, Flyboys will change forever our understanding of the Pacific war and the very things we fight for.; Biography & Autobiography , Military;Little, Brown and Company;4.99;September;2003

So are the best wiretaps FBI money can buy. * Skinny Al weighed 320 pounds and lived life to the fullest...until someone burned out his eardrums and shot his body full of holes. Hundreds of writers have tried to capture life inside the mob, but no one has ever had the inside access to write a book like this one.

A few miles and light-years away, Little Eddie LaRocca and Bobby San Filippo are on the move-dealing in everything from hot-sheet hotels to bootleg Fuji film. When the hoods are sent to find the professor, they find out that someone else is looking, too. Beautiful FBI agent Laura Russo is making her preppy partner's head spin. She knows the missing man is important-and somehow connected to a recent mob hit. While Eddie and Bobby are fighting their way through ugly deeds and pretty coeds, these feds will cook up some business of their own, turning a little disagreement among criminals into an all-out war... Capturing the organized crime world of the go-go '80s, Pistone and Bonanno's one-of-a-kind collaboration is bad to the bone-and as marvelously authentic as it gets."; Fiction , Thrillers , General;Grand Central Publishing;5.48;January;2005

Three Tall Women;By Albee, Edward;WINNER OF THE PULITZER PRIZE FOR DRAMARecently revived on Broadway in a production directed by Joe Mantello, starring two-time Oscar winner Glenda Jackson and Tony winner Laurie MetcalfEarning a Pulitzer and Best Play awards from the Evening Standard, Critics Circle, and Outer Critics Circle, among others, when it premiered, Edward Albee has, in Three Tall Women, created a masterwork of modern theater.  As an imperious, acerbic old woman lies dying, she is tended by two other women and visited by a young man.  Albee’s frank dialogue about everything from incontinence to infidelity portrays aging without sentimentality.  His scenes are charged with wit, pain, and laughter, and his observations tell us about forgiveness, reconciliation, and our own fates.  But it is his probing portrait of the three women that reveals Albee’s genius.  Separate characters on stage in the first act, yet actually the same “everywoman” at different ages in the second act, these “tall women” lay bare the truths of our lives—how we live, how we love, what we settle for, and how we die.  Edward Albee has given theatergoers, critics, and students of drama reason to rejoice.; Drama , American , General;Plume;4.99;September;1995

Six Sigma: The Breakthrough Management Strategy Revolutionizing the World's Top Corporations;By Harry, Mikel J. and Schroeder, Richard;The extraordinary breakthrough management program--heralded by GE, Motorola, and AlliedSignal--that is sweeping corporate America with its unprecedented ability to achieve superior financial results.Six Sigma is the most powerful breakthrough management tool ever devised, promising increased market share, cost reductions, and dramatic improvements in bottom-line profitability for companies of any size. The darling of Wall Street, it has become the mantra of Fortune 500 boardrooms around the world because it works.What is Six Sigma? It is first and foremost a business process that enables companies to increase profits dramatically by streamlining operations, improving quality, and eliminating defects or mistakes in everything a company does, from filling out purchase orders to manufacturing airplane engines. While traditional quality programs have focused on detecting and correcting defects, Six Sigma encompasses something broader: It provides specific methods to re-create the process itself so that defects are never produced in the first place.Most companies operate at a three- to four-sigma level, where the cost of defects is roughly 20 to 30 percent of revenues. By approaching Six Sigma--fewer than one defect per 3.4 million opportunities--the cost of quality drops to less than 1 percent of sales.This is because the highest quality also results in the lowest costs. When GE reduced its costs from 20 percent to less than 10 percent, it saved a billion dollars in just two years--money that goes directly to the bottom line. This is the reason Wall Street and corporations as diverse as Sony, Ford, Nokia, Texas Instruments, Canon, Hitachi, Lockheed Martin, American Express, Toshiba, DuPont, and Polaroid have embarked on corporate-wide Six Sigma programs.Six Sigma should be of paramount importance to every forward-thinking executive and manager determined to make their company world-class in their industry.; Technology & Engineering , Quality Control;Doubleday Business;4.99;December;1999
D-Day: A Day That Changed America: They Fought to Free Europe from Hitler's Tyranny;By Craig, David (ILT) and Tanaka, Shelley;"It was the greatest invasion the world had ever seen. Officially known as ""Operation Overlord,"" this World War II assault began on the morning of June 6, 1944. Thousands of American, British, and Canadian soldiers aboard hundreds of landing craft attacked beaches along nearly fifty miles of France's coastline in Normandy. Backing them up were the big guns of some of the mightiest ships in the Allied navies, and countless bomber, fighter, and transport aircraft. By the end of that day, an Allied army had made it ashore despite sometimes fierce opposition, signaling the end of Nazi tyranny over Europe. Using the real-life stories of young men caught up in this great event, along with original paintings, photographs, and memorabilia, D-Day, the book, will present a compelling account of this world-changing day. Shelly Tanaka is the author of many acclaimed books of nonfiction for children, including the first two books in The Day That Changed America Series: Gettysburg and The Alamo. She is also the author of Attack on Pearl Harbor and many of the books in the ""I Was There"" series."; Juvenile Nonfiction , History , Military & Wars;Hyperion;5.29;May;2004

Railroads Triumphant: The Growth, Rejection, and Rebirth of a Vital American Force;By Martin, Albro;"In 1789, when the First Congress met in New York City, the members traveled to the capital just as Roman senators two thousand years earlier had journeyed to Rome, by horse, at a pace of some five miles an hour. Indeed, if sea travel had improved dramatically since Caesar's time, overland travel was still so slow, painful, and expensive that most Americans lived all but rooted to the spot, with few people settling more than a hundred miles from the ocean (a mere two percent lived west of the Appalachians). America in effect was just a thin ribbon of land by the sea, and it wasn't until the coming of the steam railroad that our nation would unfurl across the vast inland territory.     In Railroads Triumphant, Albro Martin provides a fascinating history of rail transportation in America, moving well beyond the ""Romance of the Rails"" sort of narrative to give readers a real sense of the railroad's importance to our country. The railroad, Martin argues, was ""the most fundamental innovation in American material life."" It could go wherever rails could be laid--and so, for the first time, farms, industries, and towns could leave natural waterways behind and locate anywhere. (As Martin points out, the railroads created small-town America just as surely as the automobile created the suburbs.) The railroad was our first major industry, and it made possible or promoted the growth of all other industries, among them coal, steel, flour milling, and commercial farming. It established such major cities as Chicago, and had a lasting impact on urban design. And it worked hand in hand with the telegraph industry to transform communication. Indeed, the railroads were the NASA of the 19th century, attracting the finest minds in finance, engineering, and law.     But Martin doesn't merely catalogue the past greatness of the railroad. In closing with the episodes that led first to destructive government regulation, and then to deregulation of the railroads and the ensuing triumphant rebirth of the nation's basic means of moving goods from one place to another, Railroads Triumphant offers an impassioned defense of their enduring importance to American economic life. And it is a book informed by a lifelong love of railroads, brimming with vivid descriptions of classic depots, lavish hotels in Chicago, the great railroad founders, and the famous lines. Thoughtful and colorful by turn, this insightful history illuminates the impact of the railroad on our lives."; History , United States , General;Oxford University Press;5.08;January;1992

Live from the Battlefield: From Vietnam to Baghdad--35 Years in the World's War Zones;By Arnett, Peter;"Peter Arnett is undeniably the dean of his generation's war correspondents, a breed apart. Daring, wily, willing to put himself at enormous risk for a story. Arnett is a thinking man and a man of action.From his youth in New Zealand in the 1940s, Arnett knew journalism would be his ticket to the world. And it was - to Bangkok; then to Laos, where Arnett swam across the Mekong River to file his dispatches from Thailand; and then on to Indonesia, where he traveled with Sukarno until he was expelled after only thirteen months for his reporting on the developing war.In 1962, Arnett was sent to Vietnam along with David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan, Mal Browne, Stanley Karnow and the rest of a new young group of foreign correspondents that would later include Dan Rather, Ted Koppel and Peter Jennings. When American ground forces were committed, Arnett went right in with them. His controversial coverage for the Associated Press incurred the wrath of President Johnson but won him a Pulitzer Prize. After the fall of Saigon, when many of his peers had gone, Arnett stayed behind to get the whole story.With the dedication, passion and intelligence that one finds in great foreign correspondents, Arnett has pursued the whole story ever since. After covering wars in Cyprus and Lebanon, he joined CNN in 1981. News was going live, twenty-four hours a day, and Arnett was going with it - from San Salvador to Moscow to Iraq. And then to Afghanistan, after the defeat of the Soviet-sponsored government, a place of anarchic conflict, where Islamic radicals plot to export terrorism to the mainland United States.Satellite communications have forever changed the way we see war. Arnett's on-the-ground reporting of the Gulf War from Baghdad had an immediacy and suspense we had not experienced before. No one who watched will ever forget.Now, in the same vivid eye-of-the-Desert-Storm way in which he reported the drama and danger of the Gulf War, Peter Arnett shares the adventures, the gambles and the glory of his lifemore than thirty-five years inside the world's war zones."; Biography & Autobiography , General;Simon & Schuster;19.96;January;1994

A Patriot's Handbook: Songs, Poems, Stories, and Speeches Celebrating the Land We Love;By Kennedy, Caroline (INT) and Kennedy, Caroline;"Now available in paperback, the New York Times bestseller. When John F. Kennedy called America ""the land we love"" more than 42 years ago, he was reminding us of the lofty ideals on which our country was founded. But what are those ideals, and how have Americans defined them Is America the land of George Washington and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who rallied the country's spirits for unity in wartime, or is it a land of dissent, a land in which Frederick Douglass, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Martin Luther King, Jr. remind us of our duty to protect our most fundamental freedoms? Are we defined by the speeches of Thomas Jefferson and Ronald Reagan or by the humor of H.L. Mencken and Mark Twain? Caroline Kennedy's answer in A Patriot's Handbook is that we are all of those things and more. The poems, songs, speeches, letters, and historical documents that Caroline Kennedy has chosen for this remarkable collection remind us of the foundations on which America was built. But they also ask us to examine what it truly means to be a ""patriot,"" even if our assumptions are challenged along the way, because it is only by doing so that America can ""truly be our own.""

From the woman who has reported on every president from Kennedy to Clinton for United Press International: a unique glimpse into the White House -- and a telling record of the ever-changing relationship between the presidency and the press.  From her earliest years, Helen Thomas wanted to be a reporter. Raised in Depression-era Detroit, she worked her way to Washington after college and, unlike other women reporters who gave up their jobs to returning veterans, parlayed her copy-aide job at the Washington Daily News into a twelve-year stint as a radio news writer for UPI, covering such beats as the Department of Justice and other federal agencies.  Assigned to the White House press corps in 1961, Thomas was the first woman to close a press conference with ""Thank you, Mr. President,"" and has covered every administration since Kennedy's. Along the way, she was among the pioneers who broke down barriers against women in the national media, becoming the first female president of the White House Correspondents Association, the first female officer of the National Press Club and the first woman member, later president, of the Gridiron Club.  In this revealing memoir, which includes hundreds of anecdotes, insights, observations, and personal details, Thomas looks back at a career spent with presidents at home and abroad, on the ground and in the air. She evaluates the enormous changes that Watergate brought, including diminished press access to the Oval Office, and how they have affected every president since Nixon. Providing a unique view of the past four decades of presidential history, Front Row at the White House offers a seasoned study of the relationship between the chief executive officer and the press -- a relationship that is sometimes uneasy, sometimes playful, yet always integral to democracy.  ""Soon enough there will be another president, another first lady, another press secretary and a whole new administration to discover. I'm looking forward to it -- although I'm sure whoever ends up in the Oval Office in a new century may not be so thrilled about the prospect."""; Biography & Autobiography , Historical;Scribner;15.4;May;1999

The Joy of Work: Dilbert's Guide to Finding Happiness at the Expense of Your Co-Workers;By Adams, Scott;‘I cried because I did not have an office with a door, until I met a man who had no cubicle.’ DilbertA message from Scott Adams:I think the next wave of office design will focus on eliminating the only remaining obstacle to office productivity: your happiness. Happiness isn’t a physical thing, like walls and doors. But it’s closely related. Managers know that if they can eliminate all traces of happiness, the employees won’t be so picky about their physical surroundings. Once you’re hopelessly unhappy, you won’t bother to complain if your boss rolls you up in a tight ball and crams you into a cardboard box.As soon as I noticed this disturbing threat to workplace happiness, I did some investigative work and discovered it wasn’t confined to the issue of office design. Companies were making a direct frontal assault on employee happiness in every possible way! I knew there was only one thing that could stop the horror.It was time for another Dilbert book. It might sound corny, but I felt an obligation to society. People told me it was time for me to ‘give something back to the community.’ This scared me, until I realised that no one knows I furnished my house with street signs and park benches. So I interpreted the ‘give something back to the community’ message as a plea for me to write this book and then charge the community to read it.In the first part of this book I will tell you how to find happiness at the expense of your co-workers, managers, customers, and – best of all – those lazy stockholders. The second part of the book teaches you my top-secret methods for mining humour out of ordinary situations, thus making it easier to mock the people around you. The third part of the book is made entirely of invisible pages. If the book seems heavier than it looks, that’s why.Office Prank #44: Sounds That Drive Co-workers Crazy. You can produce sounds in the office that will drive your co-workers insane. That can be very entertaining. Every co-worker is different, so you might have to experiment to find the sounds that are most annoying to your cubicle neighbour.

Born Free: A Lioness of Two Worlds;By Adamson, Joy;"There have been many accounts of the return to the wild of tame animals, but since its original publication in 1960, when the New York Times hailed it as a ""fascinating and remarkable book,"" Born Free has stood alone in its power to move us.Joy Adamson's story of a lion cub in transition between the captivity in which she is raised and the fearsome wild to which she is returned captures the abilities of both humans and animals to cross the seemingly unbridgeable gap between their radically different worlds. Especially now, at a time when the sanctity of the wild and its inhabitants is increasingly threatened by human development and natural disaster, Adamson's remarkable tale is an idyll, and a model, to return to again and again.Illustrated with the same beautiful, evocative photographs that first enchanted the world forty years ago and updated with a new introduction by George Page, former host and executive editor of the PBS series Nature and author of Inside the Animal Mind, this anniversary edition introduces to a new generation one of the most heartwarming associations between man and animal."; Nature , Animals , Wildlife;Pantheon;5.29;May;2000

Brightness Reef (Bantam Spectra Book);By Brin, David;A million years ago, the advanced Buyur civilization held sway on Jijo. Then the Buyur abandoned the world, leaving it to rest and restore its ecological balance. Now the vast civilization of the Five Galaxies uses patrols, guardian machines, and sanctions of law to prevent resettlement until the planet is once more ready for civilized life.But over the centuries it has been resettled. Groups of sapient beings, fleeing persecution or neglect, have ignored the laws and evaded the patrols, landing in secret. After years of warfare and mistrust, a new society has evolved on forbidden Jijo, based on tolerance and respect among its six intelligent races: the mysterious hoon, the crablike qheuens, the centaurlike urs, the wheel-borne g'Kek, the multiple-personality-bearing graeki, and last of all to land on Jijo, humans from Earth, bringing with them a new technology allowing civilization to blossom in the wilderness. They all now live in hiding under canopies of camouflage, in dread of Judgment Day, when the Five Galaxies will certainly discover their illegal colony.Then the unthinkable happens. A strange starship arrives in Jijo's skies, landing near the settlers' holiest place. The passengers' appearance is familiar, their manner friendly. But do they bring long-feared judgment, or something far worse? Are they willing to destroy the six races of Jijo to cover their crimes?; Fiction , Science Fiction , General;Spectra;5.29;September;1995

But here, at long last,  Pulitzer Prize-winning critic William A. Henry III  takes on, and debunks, some basic, fundamentally  ingrained ideas: that everyone is pretty much alike  (and should be); that self-fulfillment is more  imortant thant objective achievement; that everyone  has something significant to contribute; that all  cultures offer something equally worthwhile; that  a truly just society would automatically produce  equal success results across lines of race,  class, and gender; and that the common man is almost  always right.

Seven Types of Ambiguity;By Perlman, Elliot;"Seven Types of Ambiguity is a psychological thriller and a literary adventure of breathtaking scope. Celebrated as a novelist in the tradition of Jonathan Franzen and Philip Roth, Elliot Perlman writes of impulse and paralysis, empty marriages, lovers, gambling, and the stock market; of adult children and their parents; of poetry and prostitution, psychiatry and the law. Comic, poetic, and full of satiric insight, Seven Types of Ambiguity is, above all, a deeply romantic novel that speaks with unforgettable force about the redemptive power of love.The story is told in seven parts, by six different narrators, whose lives are entangled in unexpected ways. Following years of unrequited love, an out-of-work schoolteacher decides to take matters into his own hands, triggering a chain of events that neither he nor his psychiatrist could have anticipated. Brimming with emotional, intellectual, and moral dilemmas, this novel-reminiscent of the richest fiction of the nineteenth century in its labyrinthine complexity-unfolds at a rapid-fire pace to reveal the full extent to which these people have been affected by one another and by the insecure and uncertain times in which they live.

The United States of Wal-Mart;By Dicker, John;An irreverent, hard-hitting examination of the world's largest-and most reviled-corporation, which reveals that while Wal-Mart's dominance may be providing consumers with cheap goods and plentiful jobs, it may also be breeding a culture of discontent.   It employs one of every 115 American workers. If it were a nation-state, it would be one of the world's top twenty economies. With yearly sales of nearly $260 billion and an average way of $8 an hour, Wal-Mart represents an unprecedented-and perhaps unstoppable-force in capitalism. And there have been few corporations that have evoked the same levels of reverence and ire.   The United States of Wal-Mart is a hard-hitting examination of how Sam Walton's empire has infiltrated not just the geography of America but also its consciousness. Peeling away layers of propaganda and politics, investigative journalist John Dicker reveals an American (and, increasingly, a global) story that has no clear-cut villains or heroes-one that could be the confused, complicated story of America itself.   Pitched battles between economic progress and quality of life, between the preservation of regional identity and national homogeneity, and between low prices and the dignity of the American worker are beginning to coalesce into an all-out war to define our modern era. And, Dicker argues, Wal-Mart is winning. Revealing that the company's business practices have been shaping American culture, including the nation's social, political, and industrial policy, The United States of Wal-Mart provides fresh insight into a controversy that isn't going away.; Business & Economics , Industries , Retailing;Tarcher;5.29;June;2005

Principles of Community Psychology: Perspectives and Applications;By Levine, Murray and Perkins, David V.;Principles of Community Psychology, now in a new edition, is a comprehensive text integrating theory, research, and practice across the diverse subject matter of community mental health and community psychology. Emphasizing an ecological approach, this text places problems in both their current and historical perspectives,  focusing on the individual in the environment and the influences that shape and change behavior and mental health. Conceptually built around the models of stressful life events, social support, and coping, it applies these concepts as a key integrative device for analyzing diverse phenomena and interventions which include self-help, prevention, and social action. Thoroughly updated, this second edition has been completely rewritten to include updated references and research, boxes on current topics, chapter outlines, expanded case studies, practical examples, and chapter discussions. The authors have made their arguments and research less abstract and more practical, offering students a more accessible text that presents concrete, detailed, up-to-date examples of programs, research, and scholarship from many different fields. The text covers the history of community mental health and shows its relationship to social welfare policies and legal and political systems. It also shows the limits inherent in the medical model of practice in dealing with such a full range of formal mental health problems, including the every day stressful life events that make up the Soap Opera life. Principles of Community Psychology ultimately challenges community psychologists as well as students of  psychology, sociology, and social work to look at the impact of the new conservatism on human services and the opportunities that are presented for innovative approaches in the new political climate.; Psychology , General;Oxford University Press;4.99;September;1996

Mom, Can I Move Back In With You?: A Survival Guide for Parents of Twentysomethings;By Shaffer, Susan Morris and Gordon, Linda Perlman;"A guide for the parents of the dazed and confused generation identified in the runaway bestseller Quarterlife Crisis.  Today's twenty-somethings are facing an unprecedented cultural shift in which they're feeling lost, uncertain about the future, and/or in crisis. What used to be the traditional markers of adulthood, from getting married and starting a family to earning a living, are increasingly being delayed-and it's causing as much confusion for parents as for their adult children. Quarterlife Crisis identified the difficulties twentysomethings are facing. But what about their parents? Guiding your twenty-something kid requires a whole new set of parenting skills. Here, finally, is a book to help parents navigate this tumultuous period in their adult children's lives.  Is it OK to let your kid move back in with you because he can't seem to commit to any one career-and therefore has no paycheck coming in? What do you do when your child calls you and says that her rent is due and she needs some quick cash? Just how involved should parents be in their adult children's lives? And what do twenty-somethings actually want and need from their parents? While parents are facing an urgent need for answers, few experts are talking about the subject, and there is little conventional wisdom to draw from. In this invaluable book, Gordon and Shaffer identify the complex issues these parents are facing and offer wise and effective strategies for successfully parenting a twenty-something ""kid."""; Self-help , Motivational & Inspirational;Tarcher;5.29;April;2004

Religion, Ethnicity, and Politics: Ratifying the Constitution in Pennsylvania;By Ireland, Owen S.;"In September 1787 the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed a new Federal Constitution to replace the beleaguered Articles of Confederation. Each state then had to call a convention of its own to vote on ratification. Pennsylvania, like many states, was deeply divided over the new constitution. For six months Federalists and Antifederalists fought a bitter and, on occasion, violent political battle, with the Federalists ultimately prevailing.In this detailed study of Pennsylvania, the first in fifty years, Owen S. Ireland argues that the overwhelming majority of voters in Pennsylvania favored ratification. While many modern views of the ratification conflict in America explain the Federalist success as a victory of the ""patrician"" minority over the ""plebeian"" majority, Ireland finds that political divisions were based less on class, sectional, and occupational differences than on partisan attachments rooted in religious and ethnic conflicts. The state Constitutionalist party, dominated by Presbyterians, opposed ratification, while the Anglican-led Republicans supported it. Voters from Scots-Irish and German Reformed backgrounds joined the Antifederalists, and those from virtually every other ethnic and religious group supported the Federalists.Ireland has long concentrated his scholarly work on assembling and analyzing quantitative data on politics and politicians in late eighteenth-century Pennsylvania. Here he uses the results of this research as the foundation on which to build a narrative of one of the most dramatic and significant events of the Revolutionary era."; History , United States , State & Local , Middle Atlantic (DC, DE, MD, NJ, NY, PA);Penn State University Press;9.59;July;1995
Whining: 3 Steps to Stop It Before the Tears and Tantrums Start;By Ricker, Audrey and Crowder, Carolyn, Ph.D.;Are you ready to end the whining wars in your house?  It starts with a whimper, an insistent demand, or a certain tone of voice that every parent recognizes with dread -- your child is starting to whine, and if you don't respond properly you'll have a full-blown tantrum or argument on your hands. Kids of all ages know that whining works when they want that extra hour of TV, the unplanned toy purchase, or a later curfew. But stopping such behavior without giving in to a child's demands isn't easy, and if left unchecked, whining can lead to constant disruptions at home, in school, or anywhere else your child chooses. Now the same authors who solved a common parenting problem in the national bestseller Backtalk present three proven methods for putting an end to whining, as well as information on  * The best ways to react when your child whines in a public place * Why negotiating and giving in never work -- and what you should do instead * What kids are really trying to tell you when they whine * Why whining can lead to poor self-esteem and unsatisfying social relationships -- which can follow your child into adulthood -- and what you can do about it now * How to clearly, respectfully indicate to your child what's important to you and why whining will no longer work as a means of communication  Filled with numerous real-life examples, encouraging advice, and simple steps you can start using immediately, this invaluable guide will help you end the cycle of giving in to whining only to have your child do it again, and instead replaces misbehavior with effective, meaningful, and loving parent-child communication.; Family & Relationships , Parenting , General;Touchstone;4.89;March;2000

Artful Work: Awakening Joy, Meaning, and Commitment in the Workplace;By Richards, Dick;"Work and art are not, as we have come to believe, mutually exclusive. The industrial revolution, it can be said, drove art out of work. Our new-found ability for mass production robbed workers of their art, forcing them to find ""jobs."" Work quickly came to be viewed as something we do to survive and art merely something to hang on our walls. The reward for work became extrinsic rather than intrinsic. Instead of pursuing joy within work, we began to pursue it in leisure and in the external rewards of employment. In Artful Work, Dick Richards reminds us that all work can be artful, and that artfulness is the key to passion and commitment. He applies the assumptions of artists about work and life to the challenges facing people and organizations in today&apos;s rapidly changing world. This book provides a new perspective on those challenges that is both practical and visionary, singing a provocative new tune for those journeying to make work more meaningful and joyful, and organizations more committed to their purposes. Readers will learn to take an inspired approach to their work, renewing their experience of it as a creative, participative, and purposeful endeavor. There are seven basic assumptions of the concept of Artful Work: o All Work Can Be Artful o The Reward for Artful Work Is In the Doing o The Ambition of Artful Work Is Joy o All Work Is Spiritual Work o Artistry Demands That the Artist Own the Work Process o Artful Work Requires Consistent and Conscious Use of the Self o As the Artist Makes the Work, the Work Makes the Artist Artful Work sets forth an entirely new way of thinking about all of the work we do, and the organizations that contain our work. It offers a compelling guide to honoring artistry in our work, organizations, and leadership roles, and creating workplaces that truly honor our passion. It speaks to the courageous and hopeful among us who seek to make our work and workplaces more joyful and productive."; Psychology , Industrial & Organizational Psychology;Berrett-Koehler Publishers;5.29;March;1995

From Eliza Scidmore, whose 1914 hand-tinted portrait immortalizes a Japanese child framed by chrysanthemums on page 18, to such famous names as Margaret Bourke-White and Dickey Chapelle, to the most gifted eyes of today, Women Photographers at National Geographic is a gallery of some 40 extraordinary visual talents and their finest work. Cathy Newman's informative text chronicles the adventures, achievements, and observations of four generations of remarkable, resourceful women: Annie Griffiths Belt, who passed herself off as a boy to capture a ceremony closed to women in Israel; Bourke-White, a figure of such romance and élan that she inspired the television movie Double Exposure; plucky Dorothy Hosmer, whose pictures documented her 1937 bicycle tour of Romania -- and almost went unpublished because a prim male editor found the very idea unladylike.  But the pièce de résistance is of course the photography, both in rich color and evocatively nuanced black and white: Landscapes like Edith Watson's view of Cape Breton island early in the century...portraits like Jodi Cobb's Saudi beauty, veiled but for flashing sloe eyes...scenes of lethal beauty like Dickey Chapelle's fiery Vietnamese nightmare, published only after she was killed in the field...and over 140 more, from a majestic quintet of elephants to a long-ago schoolroom of solemn, shaven-headed Russian village boys. Interspersed among the chapters are showcase portfolios of five superb contemporary women photographers, whose personal essays explore their visions and hallmark themes: ""Women on Women"" by Jodi Cobb, Maria Stenzel's ""Art of Adventure,"" Annie Griffiths Belt on ""Intimacy,"" Karen Kasmauski's gallery of ""The Human Condition,"" and Sisse Brimberg's reflections on how one links the gap ""Across Cultures.""  As Tipper Gore aptly observes in her Foreword, ""This book marks an important milestone for photography in America. I can think of no better way to begin the millennium."" Open this splendid volume to any page and you'll find the stunning proof in image after image you'll never forget."; Photography , Photojournalism;National Geographic;7.37;September;2000
The Circle of Innovation: You Can't Shrink Your Way to Greatness;By Peters, Thomas J.;"Tom Peters--brilliant, original, and perhaps the most inspiring and listened-to business thinker of our time--has a lot on his mind these days. And he wants to share it in The Circle of Innovation. The world of business is in a permanent state of flux, he argues, a state of chaos in which constant innovation is the only survival strategy--for the individual and for the organization. And he presents here a lifesaving handbook--both provocative and practical--designed to turn any organization into a perpetual innovation machine.In 400 seminars in 47 states and 22 countries in the last five years, Peters has reexamined, refined, and reinvented his views on innovation. Now he brings those seminars--and his passion--to the reader in a landmark book. It is meant, he writes, to both ""terrify"" and ""enlighten."" These are ""times of matchless peril for those who fail to grasp the nettle...and times of matchless opportunity for those who do.""To keep us alert, limber, and ready for action, he provokes and cajoles in chapter after chapter. Among his institutions and revelations:We Are All Michelangelos. He shows how to transform every ""jobholder"" into a full-fledged businessperson.All Value Comes from the Professional Services. How to convert sluggish staff units into Vital Centers of Intellectual Capital Accumulation.The System is the Solution. How to build great systems--which go far beyond nuts and bolts.Create Waves of Lust. Quality is not the automatic advantage it recently was. There is a pressing need to reverse the rising tide of product and service ""commoditization.""Tommy Hilfiger Knows. In a crowded marketplace, branding is far more important than ever before.It's a Woman's World. How to capitalize on the fact that women purchase/are purchasing agents for well over half of U.S. commercial and consumer goods.Little Things Are the Only Things. As the Blight of Sameness encroaches on market after market, design is often the best tool in services or manufacturing for sustainable differentiation.We're Here to Live Life Out Loud. Why transformational leaders of the future must have laser-like focus, tell the truth, and live on the lunatic fringe.The hallmarks of Tom Peters legend are an insatiable curiosity, an agile intellect, a pragmatic perspective, and an uncanny ability to gauge the global zeitgeist. These qualities are all brought to bear as Peters sets out to engage, enrage, and ultimately empower his readers, amid forces that are reshaping not only business but every aspect of human experience."; Business & Economics , Development , Business Development;Knopf;8.79;November;1997

Between Inner Space and Outer Space: Essays on Science, Art, and Philosophy;By Barrow, John D.;The origins of life on earth, the workings of the human mind, the mysteries of the Universe itself--profound questions such as these were once the province of philosophy and theology alone. Today they have become the staple--and indeed the hallmark--of the finest writing about science. And few science writers have tackled the big questions as persistently and as insightfully as astronomer John Barrow.        Now, in Between Inner Space and Outer Space, Barrow brings together dozens of essays that offer a sweeping account of his explorations along the boundary lines of science, philosophy, and religion.  Here is an invigorating tour of topics such as cosmology, evolution, Grand Unified Theories, complexity and chaos, the nature of time, super string theory, quantum mechanics, particle physics, Big Bang theory, and much more.  Barrow's range is remarkable. He examines, for instance, what science can tell us about our love of music or why certain paintings appeal to us. He recounts the dramatic discoveries made by the satellite COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer) and reveals what these findings tell us about the origins of the Cosmos. He discusses the debate over the nature of the universe waged by Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose. And he offers a thoughtful review of E.O. Wilson's Consilience, seconding Wilson's criticism of social scientists who remain quite ignorant of the key insights made by the life sciences.          Leavened with a sprightly sense of humor, Between Inner Space and Outer Space illuminates modern science as it provides much food for thought about life's ultimate questions.; Science , Cosmology;Oxford University Press;5.41;May;1999

The Light of Conscience: How a Simple Act Can Change Your Life;By Shore, William H.;"AN INSPIRATIONAL MEDITATION ON THE POWER OF CONSCIENCE—HOW A SIMPLE ACT, A MOMENT OF PURPOSE, CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE, YOUR COMMUNITY, EVEN THE WORLDWe all struggle at times to know what to do to seek and abide our conscience—when right and wrong are not black and white, when heart and head speak with different voices, when our intentions and interests are not aligned. If you believe that the outcome of these struggles affects the course of your life, and the lives around you, then this book is for you.If you believe that there are times and places when the choice an individual makes to speak or be silent, to eat or fast, to remain seated or to stand up in a crowd, to stare and remember or to walk on by and forget, can be as powerful as a president’s command, a congressional appropriation, or a military incursion, then this book is for you.This book is for you if your profession is rewarding financially but not spiritually, or if you’re ever worried that your career and conscience conflict.This book is for you if you are a parent whose love of your children never wavers with the anxiety they cause you but sometimes leaves you wondering whether they will grow up to do the right thing even if no one is watching.This book is for you if you question whether the countless small decisions you make each day add up to a larger judgment about your life’s meaning.Finally, this book is for you if you believe that quiet, often solitary acts of conscience have echoes louder than the original sound; that individual acts have the potential to trigger large public consequences and continue to inspire others from generation to generation; that such acts bring rewards to the individual, that unforeseen benefits accrue, that one gains more than was sacrificed, and that there is a transformative power and richness to a life so lived."; Philosophy , Ethics & Moral Philosophy;Random House;4.99;February;2004
Body & Soul;By Conroy, Frank;As A Boy, Claude Rawlings looks up through the grated window of his basement apartment to watch the world go by. Poor, lonely, supported by a taxi-driver mother whose eccentricities spin more and more out of control, he faces the terrible task of growing up on the margins of life, destined to be a spectator of that great world always hurrying out of reach. But there is an out-of-tune piano in the small apartment, and in unlocking the secrets of its keys, as if by magic, Claude discovers himself. He is a musical prodigy.Body & Soul is the story of a young man whose life is transformed by a gift. The gift is not without price - the work is relentless, the teachers exacting - but the reward is a journey that takes him to the drawing rooms of the rich and powerful, private schools, a gilt-edged marriage, and Carnegie Hall. Claude moves through this life as if he were playing a difficult composition, swept up in its drama and tension, surprised by its grace notes. Music, here, becomes a character in its own right, equaled in strength only by the music of Frank Conroy's own unmistakable and true voice.Bristling with character and invention, Body & Soul is Dickensian in its range and richness. This is a novel with all the emotional appeal and moral gravity of a classic bildungsroman, but with a tone as contemporary as a jazz riff - an unforgettable achievement by one of the great writers of our time.; Fiction , General;Houghton Mifflin Company;8.79;September;1993
Soldiering For Freedom: A GI's Account Of World War II (Texas A & M University Military History Series) (Volume 98);By Obermayer, Herman J.;Only a small percentage of the sixteen million servicemen called up during World War II saw front-line service. For the others, war involved training, reinforcement depots, tedious assignments, and lots of waiting. Herman J. Obermayer was one of those who earned a combat star without ever coming close enough to a battlefront to hear or see booming guns. Nonetheless, his letters then, and his reflection on them now, reveal important aspects of the war and the wartime world. From school, from basic training, and later from Europe, Obermayer wrote home with vivid descriptions of life in the Army. Reflective and observant, he recorded his views of both French and German reactions to the American occupation force, race relations among enlisted men, and the problems of supplying the troops as they crossed Europe after the Normandy invasion. One of the few people alive today to have seen Hermann Goering, Rudolf Hess, and other leaders of Third Reich, Obermayer wrote compellingly about the Nazis on trial at Nuremberg, describing Goering’s leadership qualities when stripped of the symbols of rank. A Jew himself, Obermayer explained his reactions at the trials when he witnessed the first documentary confirmation that six million Jews had been killed in the Holocaust. He knew and wrote about the official U.S. Army hangman at Nuremberg. Readers will find in Obermayer’s letters and connective commentary a welcome tendency to look for what went on beneath the surface, a challenging view of how his experiences cast light on today’s politics and issues, and an engrossingly human story of war behind the lines.; History , Military , World War II;Texas A&M University Press;5.73;March;2005

Had Enough?: A Handbook for Fighting Back;By Carville, James and Nussbaum, Jeff;"Have you had enough of George W. Bush and the Republican right? Are you sick and tired of the tax-cutting, environment-desecrating, secret-keeping, influence-peddling, war-mongering, free speech-hating hypocrites who occupy America's halls of power? If so, you have company -- James Carville.Like James Carville, America has been bruised and battered by the Republicans who are running our country and running it into the ground. The Bush administration has squandered a five-trillion-dollar surplus and created a five-trillion-dollar projected deficit. Their tax cut for the rich was supposed to create jobs -- but instead America has lost more than three million of them. This administration was supposed to bring honor and dignity to the White House but instead brought lies, leaks, secrecy, and fear. They promised to make the country stronger and safer but instead they've left us overstretched, isolated, and insecure.And Carville has had enough.In Had Enough? the legendary political adviser comes out of his corner swinging, taking on the Bush White House and the Republican leaders in Congress on every front -- from the economy to education to foreign affairs. But he doesn't just attack; he lays out constructive ""had enough"" solutions for healing the damage done by the Republicans and helping disheartened Democrats get back on their feet. In addition, he offers ""Ten Rules for Progressives to Live By"" and a new War Room mantra for a new era.Had Enough? is a rousing handbook for taking back the country, for fighting back the right wing, and for returning the power to the people."; Political Science , Political Ideologies , Conservatism & Liberalism;Simon & Schuster;4.99;December;2003

Mirror, Mirror & A History Of The Human Love Affair With Reflection;By Pendergrast, Mark;"Of all human inventions, the mirror is perhaps the one most closely connected to our own consciousness. As our first technology for contemplation of the self, the mirror is arguably as important an invention as the wheel. Mirror Mirror is the fascinating story of the mirror's invention, refinement, and use in an astonishing range of human activities--from the fantastic mirrored rooms that wealthy Romans created for their orgies to the mirror's key role in the use and understanding of light. Pendergrast spins tales of the 2,500year mystery of whether Archimedes and his ""burning mirror"" really set faraway Roman ships on fire; the medieval Venetian glassmakers, who perfected the technique of making large, flat mirrors from clear glass and for whom any attempt to leave their cloistered island was punishable by death; Isaac Newton, whose experiments with sunlight on mirrors once left him blinded for three days; the artist David Hockney, who holds controversial ideas about Renaissance artists and their use of optical devices; and George Ellery Hale, the manic-depressive astronomer and telescope enthusiast who inspired (and gave his name to) the twentieth century's largest ground-based telescope. Like mirrors themselves, Mirror Mirror is a book of endless wonder and fascination."; Science , History;Basic Books;5.85;July;2003

When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops?;By Carlin, George;"On the heels of George Carlin's #1 New York Times bestseller Napalm & Silly Putty comesWhen Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops?--infused with Carlin's trademark irreverent humor and biting cultural observations.Here we go again . . . George Carlin's hilarious When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops? offers his cutting-edge opinions and observational humor on everything from evasive euphemistic language to politicians to the media to dead people. Nothing and no one is safe!Despite the current climate of political correctness, Carlin is not afraid to take on controversial topics:Carlin on the media: The media comprises equal parts business, politics, advertising, public relations, and show business. Nice combination. Enough bull for Texas to open a chain of branch offices.Carlin on the battle of the sexes: Here's all you have to know about men and women: women are crazy, men are stupid. And the main reason women are crazy is that men are stupid.Carlin on hygiene: When did they pass a law that says the people who make my sandwich have to be wearing gloves? I'm not comfortable with this. I don't want glove residue all over my food; it's not sanitary. Who knows where these gloves have been? Carlin on evasive language: Just to demonstrate how far using euphemisms in language has gone, some psychologists are now actually referring to ugly people as those with ""severe appearance deficits."" Hey, Doctor. How's that for ""denial""?Carlin on politics: No self-respecting politician would ever admit to working in the government. They prefer to think of themselves ""serving the nation."" To help visualize the service they provide the country, you may wish to picture the things that take place on a stud farm.The thinking person's comic who uses words as weapons, Carlin puts voice to issues that capture the modern imagination. For instance, why are there Ten Commandments? Are UFOs real? What will the future really be like? This brand-new collection tackles all that and more.In When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops? Carlin's razor-sharp observations demolish everyday values and leave you laughing out loud--delivering exactly what his countless fans have been waiting for."; Humor , Form , Essays;Hachette Books;4.99;October;2004

The Reader's Companion to Military History;By Cowley, Robert (EDT), Parker, Geoffrey (EDT), and Society for Military History (U. S.) (COR);How did war originate? What makes a war popular or unpopular at home? How common is desertion or mutiny? What makes a successful guerrilla insurgency? How have armies been fed throughout history? The Reader's Companion to Military History addresses these and other intriguing aspects of the most destructive, fascinating, and relentless of human enterprises -- war. Filled with surprising anecdotes, little-known facts, and rare illustrations, The Reader's Companion to Military History covers major events and battles, commanders and theorists, weaponry and technological advances, and strategy and tactics. What makes the volume especially distinctive, however, is the range of thematic articles, covering such topics as courage, discipline, the effects of weather on warfare, military justice, surrender, the role of propaganda, the use of animals in war, the evolution of uniforms, psychological warfare, and morale. Unlike many military histories, the volume covers Asian, African, and South American history as well that of Europe and North America. Subjects range from the Persian Wars of 490 B.C. to such contemporary topics such as the revelations of Robert McNamara, gays in the military, and ethnic cleansing. One hundred fifty distinguished military historians, biographers, and journalists produced this volume under the editorship of Robert Cowley, editor of MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History, and Geoffrey Parker, Robert A. Lovett Professor of Military and Naval History at Yale University. The result is a remarkable chronicle of warfare that combines compelling historical narrative with the latest in contemporary scholarship.; History , Military , General;HOUGHTON MIFFLIN;10.99;November;1996

The Good Enough Teen: Raising Adolescents with Love and Acceptance (Despite How Impossible They Can Be);By Sachs, Brad E., Ph.D.;"Respected psychologist Dr. Brad Sachs helps parents to recognize their unrealistic expectations for their teenagers and to love, accept and nurture the family they have to its full potential. His approach frees them to discover acceptance of themselves and of their children. The ages twelve to eighteen are often the most challenging and trying years for adolescents––and their parents. No other phase of life is characterized by so much physical and psychological change happening so quickly. And frequently the child parents had loved and understood becomes a teenager they hardly recognize––the child who loved music grows into a teen who wants to play video games rather than the piano; or the little girl who loved dolls becomes a teen who loves staying out with her older, rebellious boyfriend. The Good Enough Teen, however, shows you how to see your child's evolution as a window of opportunity––for you, for your child, and for your entire family. Rather than having you brace for your offspring's adolescence with your eyes shut and your jaw clenched, this book will help you to understand the invisible transformation teens are experiencing, as well as the ways in which your own adolescence intimately influences this understanding. You will find yourself better able to see even your child's most exasperating behaviours as steps in his or her striving towards maturity, rather than chronic problems or mean–spirited efforts designed to make you miserable. The Good Enough Teen presents a developmental overview of what parents can expect from their children during adolescence, then delineates the five stages in the journey towards accepting a child for who he or she is. With prescriptive tools and strategies for parents, including checklists, quizzes, and exercises, and numerous case studies from the author's own practice, The Good Enough Teen is vital help for any parent with a teenager."; Family & Relationships , Life Stages , Teenagers;William Morrow Paperbacks;5.29;January;2005

The Funny Thing Is...;By DeGeneres, Ellen;"Ellen DeGeneres published her first book of comic essays, the #1 bestselling My Point...and I Do Have One, way back in 1996. Not one to rest on her laurels, the witty star of stage and screen has since dedicated her life to writing a hilarious new book. That book is this book.    After years of painstaking, round-the-clock research, surviving on a mere twenty minutes of sleep a night, and collaborating with lexicographers, plumbers, and mathematicians, DeGeneres has crafted a book that is both easy to use and very funny. Along with her trademark ramblings, The Funny Thing Is...contains hundreds of succinct insights into her psyche, supplemented by easy-to-understand charts, graphs, and diagrams so that you'll never miss a joke.  Overseeing all aspects of production, DeGeneres labored over details both significant and insignificant, including typefaces, page number placement, and which of the thousands of world languages to use. Ultimately she selected English, as it's her mother tongue, but translations into Hindi and Pig Latin are already in the works.   DeGeneres takes an innovative approach to the organization of her book by utilizing a section in the beginning that includes the name of each chapter, along with a corresponding page number. She calls it the ""Table of Contents,"" and she is confident that it will become the standard to which all books in the future will aspire.  Some of the other innovative features you'll find in this edition:  ? More than 50,000 simple, short words arranged in sentences that form paragraphs.  ? Thousands of observations on everyday life -- from terrible fashion trends to how to handle seating arrangements for a Sunday brunch with Paula Abdul, Diane Sawyer, and Eminem.   ? All twenty-six letters of the alphabet.

Stitches in Time;By Michaels, Barbara;The quilt captured Rachel Grant's imagination. An antique bridal quilt, which appeared under mysterious circumstances in the vintage clothing shop where Rachel worked, it drew her as if it had been made for her. It was beautiful, mesmerizing ... almost eerily fascinating. She little dreamed that it might hold secrets better left undisturbed.Rachel had never been able to resist the allure of finely crafted textiles from times gone by. Her research into women's crafts led her to believe that through the ages women had woven protective magic into the fabric of all they fashioned for their rites of passage: birth, marriage, and death.It never occurred to Rachel that the same power used to protect could also be used to harm. But day by day she saw and felt the power grow - the quilt was influencing her thoughts, her actions. And this was not the benign white magic of her imagination. Much as Rachel's rational mind longed to deny such an uncanny phenomenon, the aura of evil emanating from the quilt was all too frighteningly real. The carefully crafted heirloom carried a sinister legacy into the present, something that threatened to destroy the people Rachel loved.; Fiction , General;HarperCollins;18.77;May;1995

The Vacant Chair: The Northern Soldier Leaves Home;By Mitchell, Reid;"In many ways, the Northern soldier in the Civil War fought as if he had never left home.  On campsites and battlefields, the Union volunteer adapted to military life with attitudes shaped by networks of family relationships, in units of men from the same hometown.  Understanding these links between the homes the troops left behind and the war they had to fight, writes Reid Mitchell, offers critical insight into how they thought, fought, and persevered through four bloody years of combat. In The Vacant Chair, Mitchell draws on the letters, diaries, and memoirs of common soldiers to show how mid-nineteenth-century ideas and images of the home and family shaped the union soldier's approach to everything from military discipline to battlefield bravery.  For hundreds of thousands of ""boys,"" as they called themselves, the Union army was an extension of their home and childhood experiences.  Many experienced the war as a coming-of-age rite, a test of such manly virtues as self-control, endurance, and courage.  They served in companies recruited from the same communities, and they wrote letters reporting on each other's performance--conscious that their own behavior in the army would affect their reputations back home.  So, too, were they deeply affected by letters from their families, as wives and mothers complained of suffering or demanded greater valor.  Mitchell also shows how this hometown basis for volunteer units eroded respect for military rank, as men served with officers they saw as equals: ""Lieut Col Dewey introduced Hugh T Reid,"" one sergeant wrote dryly, ""by saying, 'Boys, behold your colonel,' and webeheldhim.""  In return, officers usually adopted paternalist attitudes toward their ""boys""--especially in the case of white officers commanding black soldiers.  Mitchell goes on to look at the role of women in the soldiers' experiences, from the feminine center of their own households to their hatred of Confederate women as ""she-devils."" The intimate relations and inner life of the Union soldier, the author writes, tell us much about how and why he kept fighting through four bloody years--and why demoralization struck the Confederate soldier as the war penetrated the South, threatening his home and family while he was at the front. ""The Northern soldier did not simply experience the war as a husband, son, father, or brother--he fought that way as well,"" he writes.  ""That was part of his strength.  The Confederate soldier fought the war the same way, and, in the end, that proved part of his weakness.""  The Vacant Chair uncovers this critical chapter in the Civil War experience, showing how the Union soldier saw--and won--our most costly conflict."; History , United States , General;Oxford University Press;5.29;August;1993

Chronicles of Human Stupidity;By Gregory, Leland H.;It¿s not feelings of superiority that make us suspect the universe is filled with dumb people: The universe really is filled with dumb people, as it¿s easy to see in the pages of Leland Gregory¿s sharp new offering, Hey Idiot!Gregory, a former Saturday Night Live writer, is the smart cookie who¿s previously showed us gray matter¿challenged examples in everything from the criminal world to the hallowed halls of government. This time, though, everyone, everywhere is fair game if they¿ve exhibited outrageously stupid behavior.Consider: The forgetful fireman who left cooking oil on the stove and returned from a call to find the station house burned to the ground.A lung cancer patient who caused an explosion when he lit up a cigarette¿in his oxygen tent.A 58-year-old billiards player who was suspended from competition after testing positive for a muscle-building hormone.F.

The Planets;By McNab, David and Younger, James;During the last forty years, human beings have broken free of the Earth and ventured out to other worlds orbiting the Sun. We have visited every planet except Pluto, discovered dozens of new moons in orbit around other planets, and put to rest myths and fantasies that have been accepted for centuries. This magnificent book chronicles our planetary travels, explains the creation and evolution of each planet, and tells how our understanding of the solar system has developed from the first stargazers in ancient times to Galileo to the present.In an engaging narrative that draws on interviews with U.S. and Soviet scientists and astronauts, state-of-the-art computer graphics, and space race archives, David McNab and James Younger reveal the wonders of the planets. With the help of striking pictures from the Apollo, Voyager, Pioneer, and Viking space missions, the authors describe planetary marvels: volcanoes three times the size of Mount Everest, worlds with seas of methane, rivers of lava longer than the Nile, clouds of sulfuric acid, and frosts of pure shining metal. They also investigate the possibilities of life elsewhere in the solar system, present a new perspective on the Sun and on Earth’s atmosphere, and speculate about the evolution of the solar system over the next five billion yearsto what may be its death.The book, which is a companion volume to a highly regarded, eight-part Arts and Entertainment television series, invites us on an amazing adventure, one that will stretch the imagination to its limit.; Science , Physics , Astrophysics;Yale University Press;29.29;August;1999
